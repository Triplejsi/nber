JEL No. J22, I12
ABSTRACT
We estimate the effect of poor child health on the labor supply of mothers and fathers post welfare
reform, using a national sample of mostly unwed parents and their children-a group at high risk of
living in poverty. We account for the potential endogeneity of child health and find that having a
young child in poor health reduces the mother's probability of working, the mother's hours of work,
and the father's hours of work. These results suggest that children's health problems may diminish
their parents' capacity to invest in their health.

Introduction
A growing body of research indicates that low socioeconomic status in early childhood
sets the stage for increasing disadvantages in both health and educational capital over the child's
life course and can cause low socioeconomic status to persist for generations. Case, Lubotsky &
Paxson (2002) examined why children from families with low socioeconomic status have poor
health and why the health differential between poor and non-poor children gets larger as the
children age. They presented a model in which a child's health deteriorates because of a health
shock, the negative effects of which can be offset, at least in part, by parental investments in his
or her health. Because wealthier parents will invest more in their children’s health and because
older children have been subjected to more shocks, the difference in child health between poor
and non-poor children increases with age. Currie & Stabile (2002) extended the analysis by
investigating whether poor children are less able to recover from each health shock or whether
they tend to experience a greater number of shocks. They found that the latter explains the
widening socioeconomic gap in child health with age.
These recent studies have focused primarily on causality in one direction, from income to
health, but have suggested that feedback from child health to parents’ income may play a role in
shaping children’s health trajectories. Other research, including a recent study of the effects of
child health on parents’ relationship stability (see Reichman, Corman & Noonan 2003), indicates
that child health does affect family resources and supports the notion that child health and family
income interactively and jointly determine children’s health and economic trajectories.
We use data from the national Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study of mostly
unwed parents to estimate the effects of poor child health on two potential sources of financial
resources available to the child—the labor supply of the child’s mother and that of the child’s

1

father. The time commitment involved in caring for a child in poor health may inhibit parents’
ability to participate in the labor market, resulting in both lower family income and reduced
ability to invest in the child’s health. Thus, children born in poor health may be at risk for
adverse long-term health and economic outcomes both directly (because they have the health
condition) and indirectly (through family income). We use a national sample of mostly unwed
parents and their children—a group at high risk of living in poverty—to investigate the second
issue in the post welfare reform era.

Background
Having a child in poor health imposes additional time and financial constraints for
parents that can impact their labor supply, and ultimately, the financial resources available to the
child. The added time constraints would imply reduced labor force participation, whereas
additional financial constraints might lead to increased labor force participation. Children's
health problems also may increase the cost of child care and reduce its availability, which would
likely reduce parents’ (particularly mothers’) labor force participation. The net effects of these
child health-related push and pull factors on the labor supply of mothers have been estimated in a
number of studies, but few have analyzed data collected after the implementation of the Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) legislation of 1996, which
may have dramatically altered the equation by imposing new pressure on mothers of young
children to work. Below we review the previous literature of the effects of poor child health on
maternal labor supply.
As background for her own study, Powers (2003) provides an excellent review of the
early literature on the effects of poor child health on labor supply of the mother, including a

2

previous study of hers (Powers 2001) that investigated this issue using the School Enrollment
Supplement to the October 1992 Current Population Survey. Most of the 12 studies she reviewed
found reduced labor force participation among mothers of disabled children; a few found no
effects. Although the studies varied considerably in the way they defined child disability, they
used similar sets of control variables, which included maternal sociodemographic characteristics,
family structure, and regional economic conditions. Many also included policy variables, such as
the generosity of state welfare benefits. The studies tended to focus on single mothers, although a
few also addressed the labor supply of married mothers. All used data that predated welfare
reform.
Several additional recent studies have contributed to the growing literature on this topic.
Norberg (1998) used the 1994 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to
examine the future behavior of the mother based on information at the birth of the child. She
examined the mother's labor force participation going forward each of the five years she studied.
In addition, she had specific medical information about the child at the time of the birth: whether
the child had been growth retarded in utero, whether the child had been born preterm, whether
the child had an extended length of hospitalization after birth, and whether the child had any
birth defects. She found that certain high-risk health problems at birth do reduce the mother's
labor force participation, and that the effect of poor child health is stronger in years 3, 4, and 5
than in years 1 and 2, controlling for whether the mother had a male partner at baseline and many
other maternal characteristics. The unique contributions of the Norberg study are that it: (1) used
longitudinal data beginning at the child’s birth; (2) included very detailed measures of the child’s
health; (3) analyzed labor force participation over a five year time span rather than a shorter time
interval for which it might be difficult to detect effects; (4) used a sibling fixed-effects model in

3

order to control for unobserved factors that might affect both the likelihood of a woman having a
child in poor health and of returning to work; and (5) controlled for the mother’s cognitive ability
(measured by the Air Force Qualifying Test), her work history, and her heath status.
Roberts (1999) used the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey to look at the effect
of having any family member (not just children) with a mental illness on labor market
participation and hours of work for both men and women. She found that having a family
member with mental illness did not significantly impact labor market participation for women,
but that it had a negative and significant impact on hours worked for both men and women when
physical illness was also present. The magnitude of the result was small—a ½ hour per week
reduction among those who work. A key contribution is that it considered labor force effects for
both men as well as women.
Case, Lubotsky & Paxson (2002) used data from the 1997 Panel Survey of Income
Dynamics to examine health trajectories of children by family socioeconomic status. They found
that differences in child health between poor and non-poor children increase with age, largely
because parental investments in their children’s health are inversely related to income. Although
their primary focus was on the effects of income on child health, they did suggest that child
health could affect income. In testing for causality in this (reverse) direction, they found that a
child being low birthweight or having been in a neonatal intensive care unit had no effects on
parents’ labor force participation or hours of work for each of the first three years of the child’s
life. The contributions of this study, other than their excellent analysis of the effect of income on
child health, are that they: (1) examined labor force participation of fathers as well as mothers,
(2) used longitudinal data beginning at the child’s birth, and (3) controlled for individuals’ work
history.

4

Earle and Heymann (2002) used a sample of former welfare recipients from the NLSY to
investigate the effect of poor child health on job loss. They found that former welfare recipients
were 33% more likely to experience a job loss if they had a child with an activity or schoolrelated limitation. Key contributions of this study are that it: (1) focused on former welfare
recipients--a group at high risk for employment instability; (2) controlled for the mother's health
when examining the effect of child health; and (3) controlled for local labor market conditions
and state welfare generosity.
Porterfield (2002) used 1992 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data to
examine the effect of having a child age 0-19 with a disability (defined as having a
developmental disorder for children under age six, and having any limitation on activities of
daily living for children aged 6-19) on the mother's decision to work part-time, full-time, or not
at all. She examined the effects separately for married and unmarried mothers. She found that
having a young disabled child is a strong disincentive to working full-time for both married and
unmarried mothers, and that it is a disincentive to working part-time (versus not working) among
married mothers. The unique contributions of this study are that it controlled for: (1) the age of
the disabled child, (2) whether the mother was disabled, and (3) both earnings and disability
status of the child’s father if the parents were married.
Powers (2003), using the 1991-1992 SIPP, considered the effects of poor child health on
mothers’ hours worked and changes in hours, using a number of alternative measures of poor
child health based on respondents’ reports of physical activity limitations, schooling activity
limitations, participation in therapy or diagnostic services, receipt of SSI, physical limitations to
daily living, and specific diagnoses such as autism, mental retardation, or use of walking aids
among their children who were ages 0-21. She found that child disability reduced participation

5

and hours of work for both single and married women. In addition, in models of changes in labor
force participation and hours worked, she found that, for married women, the likelihood of
participating or of increasing hours were significantly lower when a disabled child was present.
The unique contributions of this study are that it: (1) used a number of different detailed
measures of child health; (2) looked at changes in hours in addition to hours themselves; (3)
included some information about the father—age, education, and health status, and (4) included
local labor market conditions and welfare/SSI generosity.
As far as we know, Bednarek & Hudson (2003) is the only study of the effect of child
health on parents’ labor supply that used post-welfare-reform data. They used the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey from 1996-1999 to estimate the effects on maternal labor supply
(participation, full time/part time/not at all, and hours) of having a child age 0-17 with physical
and cognitive limitations, enrollment in special education or related services, or behavioral and
emotional problems (determined from the Columbia Impairment Scale). The unique features of
this study are that it: (1) separated the sample into women with a male partner in the household
(married or cohabiting) and those without a male present, whereas almost all other studies
assumed that unmarried women are single parents;1 (2) controlled for fathers’ assets, wages, and
health insurance if he was present in the household; and (3) controlled for local labor market
conditions and state welfare generosity.
The main contribution of the present study is that we estimate effects of child health on
father’s, as well as mother’s, labor supply. We incorporate detailed father variables, such as
health status, having served in the military, having received job training, and having ever been
convicted of a crime. We also advance the literature on the effects of child health on maternal

6

labor supply (and initiate the analysis of paternal labor supply) in several important ways: (1) we
include detailed father variables in the mother equation (and vice versa), even when the father
and mother are not living together (no previous studies have done this); (2) we consider a range
of parental relationships (most previous studies incorporated only marital status; the Porterfield
study considered cohabitation; no other studies looked at the range of relationships among
unmarried parents that we do); (3) we consider whether the mother and father have with children
with other partners, which can complicate the allocation of parents’ time and financial resources
within families (no previous studies have done this); (4) we account for the potential endogeneity
of child health in our models (among the recent studies that we have reviewed, only the Norberg
study directly accounted for potential endogeneity, using sibling fixed-effects); (5) we use a
longitudinal data set, so that the temporal ordering of events is clear, on a cohort of children all
the same age and starting at birth, so that the analysis is not complicated by differential timing of
births or different ages of children and the parents have not yet responded to the “shock” of
having a child in poor health (of the recent studies, only the Norberg and the Case, Lubotsky &
Paxson studies used such longitudinal birth cohort samples); (6) we analyze data 4-5 years after
the 1996 welfare reform legislation, as mothers have faced increasing pressures to work (only the
Bednarek & Hudson study used post-welfare-reform data); and (7) we include the parent’s own
employment status at the time of the birth (of recent studies, only the Norberg and the Case,
Lubotsky & Paxson studies included work history), measures of both mother's and father's own
health in mother’s labor supply equations (of the recent studies, only the Powers and the
Porterfield studies included both mother’s and father’s health in the mother’s labor supply
equation, but only for married women), and local labor market conditions in all models (of recent
1

Empirical studies have found that the wellbeing of women in cohabiting relationships (and their children) falls
somewhere between that of their married and single counterparts. See, for example, Lillard, Brien &Waite (1995),

7

studies, only the Powers, Earle & Heymann, and Bednarek & Hudson studies included such
information).

Analytical Framework
We consider the following model to estimate the effect of poor child health on a parent’s
labor supply:

(1) Labor supply = f (Own wage rate, wage rate of child’s other parent, quality and quantity of
children, labor market opportunities, availability of public support, µ)

A parent’s labor supply is a function of his or her earnings capacity (wage), the child’s
other parent’s wage, the quality and quantity of their children (together and with other partners),
their labor market opportunities, and the availability of public support. The labor supply function
may also contain another set of factors, µ, that are unobserved. To estimate this model, we need
good measures or proxies for parents’ wages, the quantity and quality of their children, and their
local labor market opportunities and policy environments. For wages, we use a set of
characteristics including age, race/ethnicity, nativity, education, work history, and health status.
We also include measures of the parents’ relationship status, which is likely to play a role in
decisions about labor market participation. We focus on the labor supply effects of one measure
of child quality—child health, but we also consider the child’s gender. For quantity of children,
we include whether the birth was a multiple, as well as whether the parents have other children
together and whether each has step-children. For local labor markets, we include city

Wu (1995), and Manning & Smock (1997).

8

unemployment rates and average wages. Finally, we include state fixed effects to capture
availability of public support that may vary by state.

Data
The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study follows a cohort of new parents and
their children in 20 US cities (in 15 states). The study was designed to take a longitudinal look at
the conditions and capabilities of new (mostly unwed) parents, the nature of their relationships,
factors that push them together and those that pull them apart, and the long-term consequences
for parents, children, and society of new welfare regulations, stronger paternity establishment,
and stricter child support enforcement. The data, when weighted, are representative of births in
US cities with populations over 200,000. Both the mothers and fathers were interviewed in the
hospital at the time of the birth (fathers were interviewed by telephone or in-person outside of the
hospital when the interview was not completed in the hospital), again when the child was one
year old, and very recently, a third time when the child was three years old. A fourth follow-up
interview with both parents is planned for when the child is five years old.2 Baseline interviews
were conducted with 4898 mothers from 1998 to 2000; 89% of the mothers who completed
baseline interviews were re-interviewed when their children were between 12 and 18 months old.

The Fragile Families data are well suited for analyzing the effects of child health on labor
force participation because they were collected as part of a longitudinal birth cohort study and
include: (1) considerable detail about labor force activity, (2) characteristics (e.g., health status)
of fathers as well as mothers, and (3) detailed information on the parents’ relationship status,

living arrangements, and other children (together and with other partners). In terms of parental
relationships, each wave of the survey asks parents whether they are married to each other,
cohabiting, romantically involved but not cohabiting, friends, or have little or no contact—and
when applicable, if they have another partner.

Descriptive Analysis
The purpose of this paper is to estimate the effects of poor child health on parents’ labor
supply. Below we describe the measures we use in our analyses, present summary statistics (in
Table 1), and point out many salient characteristics of the sample.
We estimate two labor supply outcomes for both the mother and the father: (1) whether
or not (s)he was working at the time of the follow-up interview, and (2) the number of hours that
(s)he worked the week prior to follow-up. Table 1 shows that over half (54%) of the mothers
were working. The average number of hours per week for all mothers (both working and nonworking) was 19.6; the corresponding figure for mothers who were working was 36 hours per
week (not shown in table). As we would expect, a greater proportion of the fathers (over three
quarters) than the mothers were working at the time of the follow-up interview;3 the average
number of hours worked per week for all fathers was 36.4
We also present the characteristics of the children, mothers, and fathers, as well as other
measures that we include in our models. As discussed earlier, we consider several measures of
both child quality and quantity. We consider a child to have poor health if at least one of the
following criteria is met (all are from mothers’ reports): the child weighed less than 4 pounds at

Four percent of fathers were incarcerated at the time of the follow-up interview (not shown in table).
The average number of hours per week for fathers, conditional on employment, was 45 (result not shown in table).

birth (3%),5 the mother reported at follow-up that the child had a disability (2.4%), or the child
was neither walking nor crawling (1.4%) by the time of the follow-up interview 12 to 18 months
after the birth (figures not shown in table). We used a stringent definition of low birthweight
rather than the typical 5.5-pound cutoff in order to better identify cases of serious and chronic
health problems (many of the heavier low birthweight children do not experience long-term
health problems). Our goal is to identify children with a serious health shock from birth. Six
percent of the children in our sample meet the criterion for having poor child health.6
We also include the gender of the focal child, whether the birth was a multiple, whether
the parents had any other children together, and whether each parent had at least one child with
another partner. Approximately one third of the parents had other children; about the same
proportion of both fathers and mothers had at least one child with another partner.
We go beyond whether the father was present in the mother’s household to characterize
the parents’ relationship; we consider whether the parents were married, cohabiting, romantically
involved or friends, or rarely or never talked. About three quarters of the new parents were not
married at baseline; about half of those lived together.
In general, we use mother reports for information about the mother and father reports for
information about the father. However, in cases where father's data are missing, we use mother
reports about the father if these are available. Both educational attainment and Medicaid
(whether the birth was covered by Medicaid) are included as proxies for poverty status. With
over half of the births covered by Medicaid, it is clear that a large proportion of the sample is
poor or near-poor.
5

In a separate analysis, we compared mother respondents’ reports of birthweight with the corresponding figures
from the hospital records for a sub-sample of over 1800 cases. We found exact matches (to the ounce) between the
maternal reports in the survey and the entries in the hospital charts in 76% of the cases, and matches within 8 ounces
in 94% of the cases. The correlation of babies’ birthweight from the two sources was .98.

11

We take advantage of the longitudinal nature of our data by estimating models that
control for labor supply at baseline. We control for mother’s baseline labor supply by including a
measure of whether or not the mother had worked at all in the two years prior to the birth of the
child. For the father’s baseline labor supply, we include whether the father was employed at the
time the baby was born.
We have excellent information on the father even when he was not present in the
household. In addition to his education and race, we have information on whether or not the
father had ever been convicted of a crime (37%), had received any vocational training (25%),
and had served in the military (10%). We would expect all of these measures to affect the
father’s labor market opportunities. We also include information on his (as well as the mother’s)
health status; well over half of both fathers and mothers reported at baseline that they were in
very good or excellent health.
Finally, we include city unemployment rates and wages to characterize local labor
markets; adoption and neonatal intensive care availability as identifiers for poor child health (this
will be discussed later in the sampling strategy section); and the mother’s baseline state of
residence to capture state policies and environments that may impact parents’ family formation
behaviors and labor market participation.

Modeling Strategy
As discussed earlier, having a child in poor health increases the parents’ financial and
time constraints and, as a result, their labor supply may either increase or decrease. To estimate
the effect of poor child health, we estimate Equation (1), operationalized as follows:

6

The percentages for the individual measures sum to more than 6 because some children fit more than one criterion.

12

(2) Parent’s labor supply = f (child health, other measures of child quality, child quantity,
mother and father characteristics, city labor market characteristics, state policy and economic
environments, µ)

Estimation of Equation (2) would be straightforward if the measured child health were
truly random (exogenous). It is possible, however, that despite our best efforts at measuring true
health shocks, we may capture non-random components of child health that are correlated with
unobserved determinants of the parent’s labor supply (µ) that even the state fixed effects do not
eliminate. If so, our measure of child health would be endogenous and its estimated effect on
parent’s labor supply would be biased.
Since we may not be completely successful at characterizing poor child health as a
random event, we need to consider causes of possible endogeneity. We can imagine scenarios in
which the unobserved determinants of child health and labor supply would be positively
correlated, and others in which the correlation would be negative. For example, a mother with a
strong preference for earnings and labor market participation may experience a high level of
prenatal stress (which we cannot measure) that may have adverse consequences on her infant’s
health; under this scenario, there would be a positive correlation between poor child health and
the mother’s labor market participation. On the other hand, a parent with a high rate of time
preference may be less likely than other parents to invest in both the health of the unborn child
and in a career, resulting in a negative correlation between poor child health and labor supply.
Because we cannot be certain that child health is exogenous, we model our system with two
equations, one of which expresses child health as a function of parental characteristics and health
care inputs, as follows:

13

(3) Child Health = g (mother & father characteristics, prenatal & perinatal health inputs)
Labor supply models
As described earlier, we use two different measures of the parent’s labor supply: a
dichotomous measure of whether or not the parent was employed at the time of the follow-up
interview and a censored measure of the number of the hours the parent worked the previous
week (many parents, especially mothers, had zero hours).
Parent’s labor force participation
We let CWi* represent the underlying employment status for individual i, conditional on
the health of the child and other characteristics. In particular, assume that CWi* is a function of
poor child health (CHi) and mother and father characteristics, such that:
CWi* = β CH CH i + β ' X i + ε i

(2a)

where Xi is a vector of observed characteristics and εi is the unobserved variation. Since CWi* is a
latent variable, it is not directly observed. The observed outcome, CWi, for individual i is defined
by the sign of the latent variable as follows:
1
CWi = 
0

if CWi* ≥ 0
otherwise

Parent’s hours of work
We let Hi* represent the number of hours of work for the individual i conditional on the
health status of the child and other demographic and economic characteristics. In particular,
assume that that Hi* is a function of poor child health, CHi, characteristics of the mother,
characteristics of the father, and other unobserved characteristics such that:

14

H*i = γ CH CH i + γ X' X i + ν i

(2b)

where Xi is a vector of observed characteristics and νi is the unobserved variation. Since Hi* is a
latent variable, it is not directly observed. The observed outcome, Hi, for individual i is defined
as follows:
0
Hi =  *
 H i

if H i* ≤ 0
otherwise

Child health model (Equation 3)
We assume that the probability that a child has poor health, CHi*, is a linear function of
parent characteristics and prenatal and perinatal health care availability:
(3a)

CH i* = β Z Z i + u i

where Zi is a vector of observed characteristics and ui is the error term for individual i. The data
for Zi will be taken primarily from the baseline survey.

Since CHi* is a latent variable, it is not directly observed. The observed health, CHi, for
individual i is defined by the sign of the latent variable as follows:

1
CH i = 
0

if CH i* ≥ 0
otherwise

15

Joint estimation of labor force participation and child health
To account for the possibility that child health is endogenous, we use a full-information
maximum likelihood (FIML) estimator that is based on both the labor force participation
equation and the poor child health equation. We assume that the error terms in both equations are
normally distributed and allow for the possibility that they are correlated. This estimation allows
us to test whether child health is endogenous (if it is, then the correlation between the error
terms, ρ, will be significant).
For the labor force participation equations, we use a bivariate probit specification because
the outcome measures are dichotomous. If certain conditions are met (described later) and ρ is
not significantly different from zero, it follows that child health is exogenous and that a standard
probit is the more appropriate model. We identify this two-equation system by imposing
exclusion restrictions, described in the following section.7

Joint estimation of hours worked and child health
The number of hours worked is a censored variable, and under the assumption of
normality it can be estimated using a Tobit model. To account for the potential endogeneity of
child health, we use Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML) to estimate a two-step
probit model. In the first step, we estimate poor child health and calculate predicted values. We
then use the predicted values of poor child health in the second step to estimate hours of work
using a Tobit model, and adjust the standard errors per Murphy & Toppel (1985). Such a twostep procedure is necessary in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the effects of poor child
health on hours of work if child health is endogenous.

16

Identifiers
We include proxy measures for prenatal and perinatal care in Equation (3), both because
they are predictors of child health and also to identify the systems of equations we use to test for
(and potentially to control for) the endogeneity of child health. We use two such identifiers: the
number of adoption agencies (public or private) per 10,000 women in the city in which the child
was born and the presence (or lack thereof) of a Level III neonatal intensive care unit in the
hospital where the baby was delivered.8 The first may be related to the wantedness of the child
(see, for example, Grossman & Joyce 1990, which showed that children who are more wanted
tend to receive greater levels of prenatal care). In the father labor supply models, we use the
mother’s health status as an additional identifier.
For the identifiers to be valid, they must satisfy two conditions. Condition #1: They must
be significant predictors of poor child health. Condition #2: They must be uncorrelated with the
labor supply outcome.

Results
In Tables 2 and 3, we present multivariate results for mothers and fathers, respectively,
for our two outcomes—labor force participation and hours of work. For each model, we exclude
cases for which we do not have full information at both waves. Standard errors are corrected for
city clustering of observations using the Huber-White method.

Mother’s labor supply

When valid identifiers are not available, an alternative is to set restrictions on ρ (see Altonji, Elder & Taber 2000).
Data on adoption agencies were obtained from the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse (NAIC) at
(http://www.calib.com/naic/database/nadd/naddsearch.cfm) for current data as of March 2003; population data were
obtained from the 2000 US Census; and data on Level III NICUs were collected by the authors.

Table 2 shows effects of child and other characteristics on the mother's labor supply. The
second column shows probit coefficients for whether the mother was working at the time of the
follow-up interview.9 Because the coefficients in these models are not easy to interpret, we also
present marginal effects in the third column. As discussed in the previous section, we also
estimated this model using a bivariate probit specification to allow us to test for the endogeneity
of child health. Those results, presented in Appendix A, indicate that child health is not
endogenous in the mother's labor force participation equation, as shown by the non-significance
of ρ.10
We find that having a child in poor health decreases the likelihood that a mother will
work by between 4 and 16 percentage points.11 This estimate is in the range of that found by
others (Powers 2003 and several studies reviewed in that article; Porterfield 2002; Norberg
1998).
Several other measures of child quality and/or quantity also significantly affect whether
mothers participate in the labor force. As explained earlier, we distinguish between the existence
of full biological siblings, mother's children with other partners, and father's children with other
partners. If the mother and father have other children together, the probability that the mother
works is decreased by 3 percentage points, and if she has at least one child with another partner,
the probability is reduced by 2 percentage points. The father having any children with other
partners significantly increases the mothers’ labor force participation by three percentage

9

We ran additional probit models for whether the mother had worked at all since the birth of the child. Results from
this alternative definition of maternal labor market participation were very similar to those shown here for “current”
labor market participation. Results from these auxiliary models are available from the authors upon request.
10
The tests we used for the validity of the identifiers in the bivariate probit analyses are described in detail in
Reichman, Corman & Noonan (2003). In the present analysis, we performed the same set of tests and found that
adoption agencies and level III NICUs are valid identifiers for the labor force participation equation for mothers.

The marginal effect is 10 percentage points, with a 95% confidence interval of 4-16 percentage points.

points.12 Finally, controlling for child health and all of the other covariates, neither the gender of
the child nor whether the birth was a multiple are significant predictors of the mother's labor
force participation.
The relationship status of the parents at the time of the child's birth is significantly
associated with the mother's labor force participation one year later. Whether they and the child’s
father cohabited, were romantically involved or friends, or had no relationship at baseline,
unmarried mothers are about 7 percentage points more likely to work than women who were
married.13 Thus, it appears that marital status may be a more relevant distinction than coresidence (i.e., being married or cohabiting) in determining maternal labor force participation.
Generally, mother's characteristics affect her labor force participation in the expected
directions; for example, mothers who worked in the two years prior to the birth of this child were
significantly more likely to work following the birth (it increases the likelihood by almost 40
percentage points).
We included father's characteristics even when the mother was neither married nor
cohabiting with him because (1) over ninety percent of the unmarried parents in the sample of
3998 births were in some type of relationship with one another at the time of the birth, and (2)
relationships among unmarried parents tend to be quite fluid (Graefe & Lichter 1999), with some
new parents entering cohabiting unions or forming more serious relationships after the birth of
their child (Carlson, McLanahan & England 2003). After controlling for the mother’s own
characteristics, child characteristics, and the parents’ relationship status, we find that father's

12

Wald tests indicate that the effect of the mother having at least one other child with the father is equivalent to that
of the mother having at least one child with another partner; the effect of the father having at least one child with
another partner, however, is significantly different than the effect of the parents having at least one other child
together (results not shown).
13
For the last group (those who had no relationship with the father), the effect is not statistically significant.

19

individual characteristics, as a group, significantly impact mother's labor force participation at
the 1% level (result not shown).
As expected, mother’s labor force participation is positively related to both the average
wage rate for females of childbearing age and the unemployment rate in her city. High wages are
an incentive to participate in the labor market and also may be correlated with cost of living,
which may increase labor market participation. The positive association we find between labor
force participation and city unemployment rate may reflect an “added worker effect,” in that
mothers may be working to compensate for earnings of family members who are unemployed or
in jeopardy of losing their jobs.
In the last two columns of Table 2, we present Tobit results for the number of hours the
mother works per week, as well as marginal effects that represent the average change in hours
for the 54% of mothers who are working. A shortcoming of the LIML estimator is that it does
not estimate the value or significance of the correlation between the error terms in the system of
equations (in this case, the error terms in the child health and the mother’s hours of work
equations). Our estimates for labor force participation suggest that child health is not endogenous
to hours worked, but to further test this assumption we estimate a simultaneous equation model
that treats hours worked as a censored variable and child health as continuous (results not
shown). This estimation indicates that the correlation between the error terms is not significant,
providing further evidence of the validity of the single equation results presented in Table 2.14
Having a young child in poor health significantly reduces the number of hours that
employed women work—by approximately four per week; this result is consistent with that
found by Bednarek & Hudson (2003). Having other children with the same father reduces the

We tested and found that the two instruments we used in the labor force participation model are also valid for
estimating the effect of poor child health on mother’s hours of work.

20

mother’s weekly hours of work by .8 and having at least one child with another partner reduces
her weekly hours by .1. The father having children with another partner has the opposite effect—
it increases the mother’s hours of work by 1.7 per week. It appears that mothers are working a
greater number of hours to compensate for resources being diverted to their partners’ other
children.
Mothers who were not married to their children’s fathers at baseline work approximately
two to three more hours per week than mothers who were married, holding all else constant.
Again, the effects of mother and father characteristics are generally as expected and father's
characteristics, as a group, are significant predictors of mother’s hours of work (latter result not
shown).

Father’s labor supply
Table 3 presents labor supply results for fathers. In the first two columns we present
probit estimates and marginal effects for whether the father was employed, and in the second two
columns we show Tobit coefficients and marginal effects for the number of hours the father
worked per week. Again, we tested and found that child health is not endogenous to the father's
labor force participation (bivariate probit results shown in Appendix A) or number of hours of
work.15 Hours of work were not available for the 23% of fathers who did not complete the
follow-up interview. Results from a Heckman sample selection model using data on all fathers
(results not shown) indicate that sample selection does not appear to be a significant problem. 16

15

The tests for the endogeneity of child health for father's hours of work are identical to those we used for mother's
hours. Note again that a third identifier, mother's health status, was also included in both father estimations.
16
This is not surprising, given findings by Teitler, Reichman & Sprachman (2003) that fathers in the sample who
did not complete interviews at baseline were similar on many observed measures to those who did complete baseline
interviews. In addition, characteristics of our full and restricted samples are virtually identical (not shown).

21

We find that having a child in poor health does not significantly affect whether the father
works, but it does reduce employed fathers’work effort by four hours per week. Interestingly,
this effect on fathers’ hours is very similar to the effect we found on mothers’ hours.17 The
“effects” of additional children depend on whether they are the father’s own children and
whether they are with another mother.18 The father’s hours of work are not significantly affected
by whether the parents have at least one other child together. The existence of step-children,
however, has negative effects on the father’s labor supply: When the mother has at least one
child with another partner, employed fathers works two fewer hours per week. When the father
has least one child with another partner, the likelihood that he will work is reduced by five
percentage points, and if he is employed, he will work two fewer hours per week; a possible
explanation is that child support enforcement acts as a disincentive to work, creating high
marginal "tax" rates. Another is that the father’s time commitments to other children leave him
less time to work.
Mother and father characteristics generally affect father's labor force participation and
hours of work as expected. An interesting finding is that the father having been convicted of a
crime significantly reduces the likelihood that he is working by about six percentage points and
reduces his weekly hours by 7 if he is employed. Having good or excellent health increases
employed father's hours by about two per week. Having been unmarried to the mother at baseline
is negatively related to the father's labor force participation a year later, although none of the
categories of non-marital relationship status is statistically significant.

17

The effects on parents’ hours are largely additive; a supplemental model of parents’ combined hours (not shown)
indicates that having a child in poor health decreases total hours (the mother’s plus the father’s hours) by seven per
week.
18
It is important to note that the existence of other children may be endogenous. For example, women with a greater
taste for working may have fewer children (see, for example, Nakamura & Nakamura 1994).

22

Finally, using the same covariates and model structure, we find that the effects of poor
child health on parents’ labor supply are stronger for unmarried parents than for married parents
(results for unmarried parents presented in Appendix B).19 In particular, having a child in poor
health reduces the probability that an unmarried mother is working by 13 percentage points (vs.
the 10 percentage points for the full sample, controlling for relationship status) and reduces
employed mothers’ hours of work by 5.6 per week (vs. 4 for the full sample). These results are
consistent with those from other studies (Powers 2003 and at least one study reviewed in that
article; Powers 2001; Bednarek & Hudson 2002). The relationship status measures are
insignificant in the models for unmarried mothers, which is consistent with findings by Bednarek
and Hudson and with our own finding that marital status appears to be more relevant than living
together (marriage or cohabitation) in determining mothers’ labor market participation and hours
of work. For unmarried fathers, there is still no effect of poor child health on labor force
participation, but hours of work decrease by 6 per week among those who are employed (vs. 4
for the sample of married and unmarried fathers, combined).

Conclusion
We found that having a child in poor health reduces the mother's probability of working,
the mother's hours of work, and the father's hours of work—particularly so for unmarried
parents. Although this may perhaps mean that the children in poor health are getting increased
parental resources in terms of time, it may also mean that their parents’ capacity to invest
financially in their health is diminished, placing them at increased risk for adverse health and
economic outcomes in the future.

19

We found no significant results of poor child health on labor supply or hours of mothers or fathers who were
married (results not shown).

23

A major contribution of our study is that we have provided estimates of the effects of
poor child health on the labor supply of fathers as well as mothers; we did so using a national
longitudinal data set that oversampled unmarried parents in the post welfare reform era.
Interestingly, having a child in poor health has the same effect on hours worked for fathers as it
does for mothers (a reduction of four hours per week, given that the parent is employed) and the
results we found for mothers are similar to those from studies that used different controls and
methodologies and almost exclusively used pre- welfare reform data.
An important finding is that the presence of other children and step-children have unique
associations with mothers’ and fathers’ labor supply, even after controlling for the focal child’s
health status and numerous other covariates. For mothers, having other children with the same
father is associated with a reduction in participation (having childen with other fathers has no
significant effect). But, when the father has children with another partner, mothers are more
likely to work and, for those who do work, hours increase by almost two per week. For fathers,
having other children with the mother does not significantly affect hours worked, but having
children with other mothers is associated with reductions in both hours worked and the
probability that they are employed. Additionally, having step-children also appears to serve as a
work disincentive for the father. These results highlight the complexities underlying the
economic and health trajectories of children in fragile families.
