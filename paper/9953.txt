ABSTRACT

This paper explores a little understood aspect of labor markets, their spatial geography.
Using data from New York State, we find teacher labor markets to be geographically very small.
Teachers express preferences to teach close to where they grew up and, controlling for proximity,
they prefer areas with characteristics similar to their hometown. We discuss implications of these
preferences for the successful recruitment of teachers, including the potential benefits of local
recruiting and training. We also discuss implications for the modeling of teacher labor markets,
including the possible biases that arise in estimates of compensating differentials when distance is
omitted from the analyses. This study contributes to the literature on the geography of labor markets
more generally by employing data on residential location during childhood instead of current
residence, which may be endogenous to job choice.

Introduction
School districts across the country are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit new,
well-qualified teachers. This is especially true for urban schools with high concentrations of
poor, non-white, and low-performing students. States and school districts have responded with a
variety of policies to attract and retain more qualified teachers in these difficult-to-staff schools.
Some states and districts employ signing bonuses; others have mounted aggressive, often farreaching, recruitment campaigns to attract prospective teachers. Still other efforts focus on
broadening entry to the profession through alternative certification programs.
Policies to attract and retain teachers develop with little guidance from research. The
nature of the labor market for teachers is complex, involving the interaction of a wide variety of
institutions, policies, and practices, the result of which affects both the supply and demand for
teachers. In this paper, we explore a little understood but potentially important feature relating to
the recruitment of more qualified teachers to schools: the geographic scope of teacher labor
markets. We are particularly interested in how prospective teachers delineate the geography of
their job search. How broadly are teachers dispersed from prior places of residence and what
attributes of teachers affect this geographic span? We find that teachers delineate their job
searches to relatively small geographic areas, very close to where they grew up. While
preferences vary somewhat by the characteristics of the individual teachers, distance appears
important for all groups of teachers that we analyze.
The preference for geographic proximity has implications for policies regarding the
training and recruitment of teachers, suggesting potential benefits of local recruitment and
training. It also has implications for how models of teacher labor markets are conceptualized,
given that the omission of distance as a factor in teachers’ choices may bias estimates of
compensating differentials, and, more generally, of teachers preferences for various job
characteristics.
The next section of the paper motivates our interest in examining the geography of
teacher labor markets and reviews research pertaining to the geography of labor markets.
Section three describes the data. The fourth section examines the geographic scope of teacher
labor markets both descriptively and through a behavioral model. The final section summarizes
these findings and examines their application to policy issues in the recruitment of teachers.

Background
Lankford, Loeb and Wyckoff (2002), using several measures of teacher characteristics,
find that there is wide variation in the qualifications of teachers across schools. Urban schools
and those with lower-performing students are much less likely to employ highly qualified
teachers.1 Table 1 shows that in schools where more than 20 percent of the students performed
at the lowest level on the 4th grade English Language Arts (ELA) exam, 35 percent of the
teachers had failed the general knowledge portion of the certification exam at least once
compared to 9 percent among teachers in schools in which none of the students had scored at the
lowest level on the 4th grade ELA exam. Correlations between school achievement and teacher
characteristics tell a similar story; the proportion of a school’s students who achieved at Level 1
has a 0.63 correlation with the proportion of that school’s teachers who are not certified to teach
any of their current courses. The correlations for the proportion failing either the National
Teacher General Knowledge Exam or the New York State Teacher Certification Liberal Arts and
Science exam are both 0.50, and the correlation of student achievement with teacher graduation
from a less competitive college is 0.41. The results are similar if we use the 4th grade
mathematics exam or the 8th grade ELA and math exams. Similar results also hold if students
are partitioned by race or poverty status. The results of these analyses are clear. There is strong
evidence that students in difficult-to-staff schools are taught by the least qualified teachers.
What accounts for this extraordinary sorting of teachers? It could result from either
sorting of teachers in their first job placements or from differential exits and transfers that cause
more qualified teachers to leave low-performing schools and transfer to higher performing
schools. Boyd, Lankford, Loeb and Wyckoff (2002) find that although both explanations
1

Measures of teacher qualifications include: the percent of teachers not certified in any current teaching assignment,
the percent of exam takers who failed the National Teacher General Knowledge Exam or the New York State
Teacher Certification Liberal Arts and Science exam on their first attempt, the percent who attended colleges
Barron’s College Guide rated most competitive and highly competitive schools, the percent who attended
competitive, less competitive, or least-competitive colleges.
New York’s student achievement data for 4th and 8th grade English Language Arts (ELA) and Math place each
student’s test results in one of four performance levels. The school data indicate the number of students in each
level. To examine low-performing students we employed the portion of the students tested whose results place them
in the lowest performance group, Level 1. Level 1 for 4th grade ELA is described by the New York State Education
Department as, “These students have serious academic deficiencies. They show no evidence of any proficiency in
one or more of the elementary standards and incomplete proficiency in all three standards.”

account for some of the sorting of teachers, first job placements that match less-qualified
teachers with lower performing schools are generally most important. Because of this, we focus
our analysis on the location of job search behavior of entering teachers.
There is a large and rapidly growing literature on job search and labor market
segmentation (see Martin (2000) for a review). Much of the recent research has concentrated on
issues of market segmentation and spatial mismatch. That work focuses on the extent to which
differential access to employment is related to residential segregation (spatial mismatch) and
social networks (market segmentation). Although distance can be an important component to
hypotheses concerning spatial mismatch and market segmentation, much of this research embeds
distance in a discussion of interpersonal relationships and institutional access. This research
frequently employs two alternative approaches—analyses of distance from home to work and
surveys of employees and/or residents concerning their job search activities.
Researchers examining the spatial mismatch hypothesis often use Census data to examine
the attributes of individuals, residential neighborhoods, commuting patterns and occupation
within a particular metropolitan area (Scott, 1992). This research frequently finds support for the
spatial mismatch hypothesis that racial and ethnic minorities live in neighborhoods further from
more attractive employment opportunities, reducing their likelihood of being hired.
Market segmentation research relies on relatively small-scale surveys to better understand
how personal and social networks affect employment outcomes (Hanson and Pratt, 1992). This
research documents the importance of social networks in connecting individuals to employment
opportunities. Labor markets are found to be ‘local’, although local is more complex than
distance. Nonetheless, this research also finds that labor markets are often geographically small,
either because distance is an important component of the theory (spatial mismatch) or because
distance is negatively correlated with development of networks that underlie market
segmentation.
As Martin (2000) observes, workers frequently exhibit a strong attachment to place
which results in the ‘spatial fixity’ of local labor and the accompanying potential for differences
in wages and other attributes across local labor markets. Additionally, residential immobility
and sorting create segmented labor markets even within what would be considered typical travel
to work areas. Thus, the emerging literature on local labor markets suggests that labor market

3

segmentation creates the potential for markets within markets where differences in wages,
working conditions and worker qualifications can be maintained over extended periods of time.
Gregory and Borland (1999) review the literature on public sector labor markets and
suggest that markets for teachers may reflect restricted geographic scope and exhibit little
interdependency with private-sector labor markets, which could lead to differences in the
qualifications and terms of employment for teachers within relatively small geographic areas.
Notably, however, Gregory and Borland, however, do not identify any studies that examine the
geographic scope of labor markets.
The empirical literature examining the geography of labor markets provides evidence on
the importance of the spatial and social interactions of employers and employees within
relatively small geographic areas. The underlying assumption of most of this work is that
individuals have chosen to live in particular locations and explore their employment
opportunities conditional on that residential location. One potential problem with this approach
is the endogeneity of residential location. Workers may choose their residence with a view
towards employment prospects. In this paper we are able to avoid this problem by using data on
residential location during high school. A second potential problem with assessing preferences
for geographic proximity to home is separating employers’ preferences from employee’s
preferences. In this paper, we reduce this difficulty by assessing the choice of region of work,
instead of the choice of specific jobs. We, thus, do not assume that employees have choice over
all jobs, but use a much weaker restriction that employees have choice over region of work. As
reported below, we find substantial evidence that distance plays an important role in job choice.
These preferences can explain some of the relative disparities in employee qualifications across
schools and the relative difficulty of urban schools in attracting teachers.
Data
We examine the geography of teacher labor markets by linking the locations of New
York teachers at several points during their lives. We observe where individuals take their first
public school teaching position. For a majority of these teachers we know their residential
location during high school (hometown) and for most of them we know where they attended
college before taking their first job. Based on this information, we examine the relationship
between the region of a teacher’s first teaching job and the locations of his/her hometown and

4

college. We also explore how other attributes of teachers (e.g., gender or the qualifications of
teachers) and of place (e.g. urbanicity) affect the geographic scope of teacher labor markets.
Our database links six administrative datasets and various other information
characterizing districts, communities, and local labor markets. It includes information for every
teacher and administrator employed in a New York public school at any time from 1984-85
through 2001-2002. The core data comes from the Personnel Master File (PMF), part of the
Basic Education Data System of the New York State Education Department. In a typical year
there are approximately 200,000 teachers identified in the PMF. Several other databases that
contain a range of information about the qualifications of prospective and actual teachers, as well
as the environments in which these individuals make career decisions, substantially enrich this
core data. Based on records from the College Board, the State University of New York,
applications for teacher certification, and current employment information, we know the
locations of teachers at various points during their lives. We also know the attributes of students,
schools, and as described above, the qualifications of teachers. See Appendix A for a description
of the administrative datasets that we have linked together for this analysis. In our analysis,
teachers choose the location of their first job from one of 17 different regions—the urban or
suburban regions of seven different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), and three rural
regions of New York State. These areas exhaust the geography of New York State.
We identified the hometown from the location of the high school they attended when they
took the SAT exam or the address they used when they applied to college.2 This information is
known for individuals who took the SAT in a New York secondary school since 1980 or anyone
who applied to any of the 64 State University of New York colleges or universities since 1990.
These data sources provide a hometown for 59 percent of the first-year teachers hired from 199899 through 2001-02 (1999-2002). Hometown data is available for 49 percent of the teachers
whose first job is in a New York City public school. It is possible that there is a selection bias
associated with the hometown variable—individuals who did not take the SAT in New York or
did not apply to a SUNY college may be more likely to have hometowns further from their first
job than those for whom we observe hometown. We do observe the location of the college
teachers attended for over 86 percent of all first-year teachers and 73 percent of the first-year
teachers for whom we do not observe hometown. We have duplicated all of the analyses

presented in this paper using the expanded sample substituting college location and distance
from college to first job for information based on hometown. Doing so does not change any of
the substantive conclusions presented.
Our approach to understanding teacher labor market geography is to examine descriptive
relationships, and then develop a behavioral model of first-job location for newly hired teachers.
Labor Market Geography
Descriptive analysis. Most public school teachers take their first public school teaching job
very close to their hometowns or where they attended college. Sixty-one percent of teachers
entering public school teaching in New York from 1999 to 2002 started teaching in regions
located within 15 miles of their hometown (Table 2). Eighty-five percent entered teaching
within 40 miles of their hometowns. Table 2 presents results separately by metropolitan area. In
each of the regions teachers take first jobs very close to home, however, there are differences.
For example, in New York City, 90 percent of all teachers take a first job within 40 miles of their
hometowns while in the City of Rochester, only 65 percent of novice teachers took jobs within
40 miles of home.
Although 41 percent of first-year teachers are missing a hometown variable, this does not
appear to bias these findings. Those observations with hometown missing but for whom college
location is known are just as likely to take a job within 15 miles of the college from which they
received their most recent degree (37 percent) as observations for which hometown is available
(37 percent) (Appendix Table B-1).
Table 3 shows that hometowns have a somewhat greater pull than place of college. Of
those who received their most recent degree at least 100 miles from home (24 percent of all
observations), 48 percent took jobs within 15 miles of their homes and 72 percent within 40
miles of home. These teachers went ‘away’ to college but returned home to work. In contrast,
of those teachers who took jobs at least 100 miles from home (7 percent of all observations),
only 17 percent were within 40 miles of the institution at which they had received their most
recent degree.
These patterns may reflect more than just preference for proximity. For example,
individuals may search for employment in regions with which they are familiar, independent of
the distance from their hometown. These similarities may be specific to their hometown region,
6

e.g., familiarity with a specific school system, or more generically to a type of situation, e.g.,
familiarity with urban school environments. Over 90 percent of the individuals whose
hometown is New York City and who entered public school teaching from 1999 to 2002 first
taught in New York City (Table 4, row percentage). About 60 percent of those having
hometowns in the New York City suburbs first taught in those suburbs. Other major urban areas
follow a similar pattern. Teachers with hometowns in urban locations are more likely to take a
first job in that urban district relative to its suburbs, and those whose hometown is in the suburbs
are much more likely to initially teach in those suburbs, rather than the nearby urban district
(Table 5). Eighty-eight percent of teachers whose hometown is in an urban district first teach in
an urban district, although only 60 percent of urban teachers come from urban hometowns. Fully
36 percent of urban teachers originate in the suburbs, while only 6 percent of suburban teachers
have hometowns in urban regions.3 Although distance may play a role in these results, it is also
the case that apart from distance, the culture of schools or communities may play some role in
the segmentation of teacher labor markets.
Urban districts typically are net importers of teachers from the suburbs. In Buffalo, New
York City, Rochester and Syracuse, the ratio of those with suburban hometowns who take jobs in
the city relative to those with urban hometowns who take jobs in the suburbs ranges from 2.6
(Buffalo) to about 7.5 (New York City). Thirty percent of the teachers taking their first job in
New York City public schools had hometowns in the New York City suburbs. The need for
urban schools to import teachers, in combination with preferences to be close to home or in areas
with characteristics similar to home increases the difficulty of recruitment for urban districts.
Much has been made of the difficulty of recruiting math, science and special education
teachers. As a result, one might imagine that the effect of distance and the pull of home may
differ by field of specialization, as recruitment efforts would be more intense in difficult-to-staff
subjects. Table 6 gives the distance from hometown and college to first job, by area of primary
teaching responsibility. There is little evidence that labor market geography for difficult-to-staff
teaching specialties differs from that for other teaching areas.
These descriptive analyses suggest that individuals typically take jobs very close to their
hometowns, and to a lesser extent, close to the college or university from which they obtained

Again, these patterns are supported when location of most recent college is substituted for hometown location.

their most recent degree prior to their first job. The analyses also suggest that the urbanicity of
the schools may play some role apart from distance. To gain a better perspective on the role that
these and other factors might play in the identification of relevant labor markets for prospective
teachers we model these decisions in a multivariate framework.
A model of teacher job search. Ultimately, the specific schools where individuals first teach
reflect a two-sided match between employers and employees and as a result, the preferences of
both the teachers and the administrators who hire them. We have addressed this two-sided
matching process in a related paper by simultaneously estimating the preferences of both sides of
the market (Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff, 2003), The intent of this paper is different. We
examine teachers’ first-job preferences across geographic regions. The assumption that, while
teachers may not be able to choose the specific school they teach in, they are able to choose the
region, allows us to limit the problem to an unconstrained choice model for teachers. We
estimate the region in which a teacher selects his/her first job as a function of teacher
characteristics and characteristics of the region, including distance from hometown and college.
In our analysis, teachers choose the location of their first job from one of 17 different
regions of New York State described above. Because there are numerous opportunities for
prospective teachers to find jobs within each region, it is reasonable to assume that teachers can
unilaterally choose to focus job search within one of these regions. Table 7 summarizes the
hiring of teachers in school districts and schools for each of the 17 regions during the 2000-01
school year. Most of the urban areas contain only one school district, but each of these districts
typically has many schools hiring numerous first-year teachers in any given year. Regional
averages indicate that there were more than 1000 novice teachers hired in more than 240
different schools in 2000-01. The region with the smallest number hired more than 50 teachers
in 20 different schools. Thus there are numerous opportunities for entering teachers within each
region. As shown in Table 8, the number of districts and schools hiring and the number of
positions filled have remained fairly stable across the years in our analysis. As is the case
nationally, hiring increased in more recent years.
We assume that teacher m maximizes utility, Umj, by selecting a region j in which to
begin teaching. This region is one of J mutually exclusive regions in which he/she could teach.
Region j is chosen so long as Umj > Umk for all k≠j. In our empirical model, we specify Umj as a

8

function of distance from the region to the teacher’s hometown, distance from the region to the
college where the most recent degree was earned, individual attributes of the teacher, regional
attributes, and a random error term. Employing a standard random utility model, we assume that
the error term is Gumbel-distributed implying a multinomial logit specification. The probability
that a teacher chooses to locate in region j is:
Pr ob( J = j ) =

e

β 'j xi

1+ ∑ e

.
β k' xi

k =1

Where the xi are defined as:
Distance from home to each region in a cubic functional form
Home distance interacted with:
Female: equals 1 if the individual is female, 0 otherwise
SAT: individuals combined math and verbal SAT scores
Urban: equals 1 if region is urban, 0 otherwise
Rural: equals 1 if the region is rural, 0 otherwise
Region is home: equals 1 if the region is the home region; 0 otherwise
Region is home interacted with urban and rural
Region and home same type: equals 1 if region and home are of same urbanicity
Region and home same type interacted with urban and rural:
Region is other portion of home metro: equals 1 if region is other portion of home MSA,
0 otherwise
Distance from college to each region in a cubic functional form
Distance from college interacted with female and rural
Graduated from college in region: equals 1 if individual received most recent higher
education degree from an institution in the region, 0 otherwise
Since choices among regions are relative to each other, variables that do not interact with
regional attributes are irrelevant to the choice. We allow teachers’ evaluations of the importance
of distance to vary by individual attributes. For example, higher ability teachers may value
distance from hometown differently than do lower ability teachers.
We estimate the model with observations for 33,474 first-time teachers who took jobs in
New York State public schools from 1998-99 to 2001-02. Parameter estimates and odds ratios
for the estimated model are shown in Table 9.4 Distance from hometown is both statistically and
4

To examine the sensitivity of the analysis to the definition of region, we also run the multinomial logit estimates
for 10 regions where each of the seven MSAs was defined as a single region (collapsing the urban and suburban
portions of each). We do this out of concern that teachers in urban schools, for example, could not find any jobs in
the corresponding suburban area. The results of this analysis, reported on Appendix Table B-3, are substantially the
same as those for the 17 regions, as reported below. None of the major conclusions of the paper are altered.

quantitatively important to teachers’ location decisions. As shown in Figure 1, an individual is
twice as likely to teach in a region that is within five miles of his or her hometown as one 20
miles away and about four times as likely to teach in a region within five miles of his or her
hometown as one 40 miles away. A beginning teacher is more than three times as likely to teach
in a region 25 miles from her hometown as one 80 miles away. Teachers place a premium on
searching for jobs close to their hometowns, other things equal including distance from college.
First-year teachers also have strong preferences to locate in regions similar to that of their
hometowns, other things (including distance) equal. For example, a new teacher whose
hometown is in an urban area is three times as likely to locate in that urban area, as he/she is to
locate in the suburban portion of the same metropolitan area (Table 10). However, again holding
distance constant, a teacher is just as likely to locate in his or her home region, as he/she is to
locate in the urban portion of another metropolitan area. Suburban teachers express a stronger
preference for their home region. Controlling for distance, a teacher with a suburban hometown
is 4.5 times as likely to locate there as in the urban portion of the same metropolitan area and
three times as likely to locate in that suburban region as a suburban region in a different
metropolitan area. Thus, a prospective teacher who grew up in a particular suburban area is
much more likely to take a job in that suburban region, relative to urban and rural areas. Among
suburban regions, they show strong preference for their hometown region relative to the
suburban region of another metropolitan areas (Figure 2 and Table 10). Prospective teachers
whose hometown is in a rural region prefer to locate in other rural regions relative to urban or
suburban locations, although this preference is not as strong as those with urban or suburban
hometowns. The strong preferences of teachers for locating in the region of their hometown, or
to a lesser extent, a region of similar urbanicity may reflect a variety of social and cultural
factors, but these preferences have important implications for the recruitment of teachers to
urban, low-performing schools.
Both distance and hometown region have powerful effects on individuals’ employment
location decisions but what is the relative importance of these factors? In terms of the tradeoffs
implied by the parameter estimates, an individual whose hometown was in a suburban region
In order to test whether missing data is likely to bias our estimates, we run models that omit the variables related to
hometown for the sample of observations with hometown information and for the sample for which hometown was
missing. See Appendix Table B-4. The results across these two samples are substantially the same and none of the
major conclusions presented are altered.

would be indifferent between locating in another suburban region that is 5 miles away and the
hometown region if that region were 31 miles away. In other words, the value of working in
their hometown region, relative to another suburban region, is worth traveling 26 miles further.
When comparing the hometown region and a region of a different type, the individual would be
indifferent if the hometown region were 37 miles further away. Finally, an individual would be
willing to travel 5 miles further to work in another suburban region rather than a different type of
region. Recall that reasonably small differences in distance can lead to relatively large changes
in the odds ratio of locating in a particular place, e.g. an increase of 15 miles can lead to a
doubling of the odds ratio. This implies that the effects of hometown region are substantial
relative to distance, but that the effect of locating in a region of a similar type is much more
modest.
The importance of distance to an individual varies only slightly by the individual’s own
attributes. For example, an individual with a total SAT score of 1000 is three times as likely to
locate in a region 5 miles from her hometown as one 31 miles from her hometown, other things
equal (Figure 3, base case). An otherwise identical individual with a 1200 SAT score would
have the same odds ratio for a region 35 miles away. Thus more qualified teachers are willing to
expand their job search, but only slightly. The effects of gender and the region of your home,
e.g., urban, are even smaller.
The model also suggests that holding distance to hometown constant, new teachers are
sensitive to the distance from where they last obtained a college degree prior to starting their first
job. New teachers are 36 percent more likely to locate in the region where they received their
last degree relative to another region, other things equal (Figure 4). However, as shown in Table
11, proximity to hometown is substantially more influential than proximity to college location,
except for individuals with urban hometowns. Female teachers who grew up in suburban regions
but went to college in a different suburban location 20 miles away are more than 2.8 times as
likely to teach in their hometown region as in the region where they attended college.
Individuals with urban hometowns who attended colleges in urban regions are about as likely to
teach in the region of their college as their hometown region.

11

Discussion and Conclusions
In seeking their first teaching jobs, prospective teachers appear to search very close to
their hometowns and in regions that are similar to those where they grew up. Location of college
plays an independent, although less important role in teachers’ employment location decisions.
These conclusions are supported by descriptive statistics and our estimated behavioral model.
Moreover, these results are robust to several alternative specifications.
The importance of distance in teachers’ preferences particularly challenges urban
districts, which are net importers of teachers. The number of teacher recruits whose hometown
is in an urban area falls short of the number of positions being filled in urban districts, requiring
that these districts attract teachers from other regions.5 Teacher candidates coming from
suburban or rural hometowns strongly prefer to remain in those areas, rather than teach in the
urban districts -- both because of the importance of distance and because teachers have
preferences with respect to urbanicity. Thus urban districts must overcome these preferences in
addition to addressing the considerations typically identified with recruiting teachers to difficultto-staff urban schools, such as salary, working conditions and the characteristics of the student
population. In general, urban schools must have salaries, working conditions or student
populations that are more attractive than those of the surrounding suburban districts to induce
sufficiently qualified candidates whose hometowns are in suburban regions to take jobs further
from home and in a different type of region. To the extent that they do not, teachers with
suburban hometowns who take jobs in urban areas are likely to be less qualified than those who
teach in the suburbs. Moreover, urban districts face a second disadvantage. If, historically, the
graduates of urban high schools have not received adequate education, then the cities face a lessqualified pool of potential teachers even if they are not net importers. Preferences for proximity
lead to the perpetuation of inequities in the qualifications of teachers. Inadequate education is a
cycle that is difficult to break.
One strategy for attracting more qualified teachers from non-urban regions is to offer
compensation for teaching in areas that are net importers of teachers. Boyd, Lankford, Loeb &
Wyckoff (2003) estimate these compensating differentials. A complementary strategy focuses
on the recruitment of individuals living in the urban districts to teacher education programs and
5

This is true for each of the major urban areas in New York (Buffalo, New York City, Rochester, Syracuse, and
Yonkers).

12

employment in urban schools—a “grow-your-own” strategy. Given the strong preferences for
teaching close to home and that most students attend college close to home, an important part of
the solution is likely to be partnerships between urban schools and higher-education institutions
in close proximity to the district. This then places a premium on teacher preparation and
recruitment in urban areas, where the graduates are most likely to become the teachers in
difficult-to-staff urban schools. In addition to heightened recruitment efforts, increased
compensation for urban teachers would increase the supply of urban residents to teaching.
The results have implications with respect to the geography of teacher labor markets
more generally. The common practice of conceptualizing teacher labor markets as covering
large regions, or the nation as a whole, can be quite misleading. Such a view leads to the
conclusion that there is merely a mismatch in the geographical location of well-qualified teachers
and the students who most need them. Our analysis implies that it may be more difficult than
previously thought to create the incentives necessary to alleviate this mismatch. Rather, viewing
teacher labor markets as geographically small focuses attention on the margins where incentives
are most likely to be effective.
The small geographical scope of teacher labor markets also needs to be taken into
account in empirical analyses. Proximity to home, home region and similarity to home region
are important in teachers’ employment preferences. Research examining compensating
differentials that does not account for these job attributes will likely miss-estimate the
compensation necessary to successfully recruit teachers. A substantial body of research
estimates teachers’ decisions to enter teaching, quit or transfer. Such research may also be
misleading if it omits distance from the list of potential factors affecting teachers’ choices.
Finally, many of the implications noted here may extend beyond public school teachers.
Other street level professionals, especially those in the public sector, share attributes of public
school teaching. Labor markets for these occupations are likely to be small, as well. As a
result, recruiting more qualified public safety, health care, and social service workers may follow
many of the policy recommendations noted above.
There is little research on the geography of labor markets. The research that has been
done has tended to look within metropolitan areas, addressing questions of spatial mismatch and
market segmentation. This paper takes a different approach, assessing employment location
decisions across regions and using residential location in high school instead of current residence

13

to define measures of distance. By doing this, we are able to limit our behavioral model to a
one-sided choice and reduce the potential that home residence is endogenous to employment
opportunities. The results show the importance of proximity for teachers and suggest the need to
consider local supply when designing policies to affect the recruitment and retention of teachers.
