NBER Working Paper No. 9973
September 2003
JEL No. J5
ABSTRACT
We explore the various claims made by Freeman and Medoff (FM) in their famous book What do
unions do? about the impact of unions on wages and update them with new and better data. The
main findings are as follows. 1) Private sector union wage premium is lower today than it was in the
1970s. 2) The union wage premium is counter-cyclical. 3) There is evidence of a secular decline in
the private sector union wage premium. 4) There remains big variation in the premium across
workers. 5) There is big variation in industry-level union wage premia. 6) State level union wage
premia vary less than occupation and industry level premia. 7) Union workers remain better able
than non-union workers to resist employer efforts to reduce wages when market conditions are
unfavorable. 8) There has been a decline in the unadjusted wage gap relative to the regressionadjusted wage gap. 9) Public sector wage effects are large and similar to those in the private sector.

“Everyone ‘knows’ that unions raise wages. The questions are how much,
under what conditions, and with what effects on the overall performance of
the economy”. What Do Unions Do?, Freeman and Medoff, 1984, p.43
In 1984 Richard Freeman and James Medoff (FM) published their pathbreaking book What Do
Unions Do?. The book has had an enormous impact. According to Orley Ashenfelter, one of the
commentators in a review symposium on the book published in January 1985 in the Industrial
and Labor Relations Review, 38(2), pages 245-258, the response of the popular press to the book
‘has only been short of breathtaking’ (p.245)1. It received rave reviews at the time it was written
and unlike most books has withstood the test of time: it is certainly the most famous book in
labor economics and industrial relations. One of the other reviewers in the symposium, Dan
Mitchell called it ‘a landmark in social science research’ and so it has proved (p.253). We went
to the Social Science Citations Index and typed in ‘What do unions do’ (henceforth WDUD) and
found it had been cited by other academics more than one thousand times2. In what follows we
will show that the vast majority of their commentary written in the early 1980s is still highly
applicable today despite the fact that private sector unionization has been in precipitous decline
since they put pen to paper or maybe it was even fingers to keyboard! An old adage is that a
classic book is one that everyone talks about but nobody reads. This book is not one of those. It
is a classic in the true sense because it continues to be a book that anyone – scholar or layman interested in labor unions needs to read!

Central to the thesis propounded by FM there are two faces to unions – the undesirable
monopoly face – which enables unions to raise wages above the competitive level which results
in a loss of economic efficiency. This inefficiency arises because employers adjust to the higher
union wage by hiring too few workers in the union sector. The second more desirable face to be
examined in detail by others in this volume, is the collective voice face which enables unions to
channel worker discontent into improved workplace conditions and productivity. This chapter
concentrates on the monopoly face of unions and its impact on relative wages. We explore the
various claims made by FM about the impact of unions on wages and update them with new and
better data.
We examine in some detail the role of the public sector, which was largely ignored by
FM. This was a perfectly understandable omission at the time but is less appropriate today given
the importance of public sector unionism in the US.3 In Section One we report FM’s main
findings. In Section Two we discuss the main labor market changes that have occurred since
WDUD was written. Section Three reports our estimates of wage gaps disaggregated by various
characteristics used by FM. We also examine wage gaps that FM did not examine, namely those
in the public sector and for immigrants. Section Four examines time series changes in the union
wage gap. Section Five models the determinants of changes in the union wage premium at the
level of the industry, occupation and state. In Section Six we outline our main findings and
discuss whether FM would have been surprised about these findings when they wrote WDUD.
1. Summary of FM’s findings on union wage effects.
FM reported that early work used aggregate data on different industries, occupations and areas.
Much of this work was summarized in Lewis (1963). The reason that such aggregated data were
used was that ‘data on the wages of unionized versus non-unionized individuals or
establishments was neither available nor, given the state of technology, readily amenable to
2

statistical analysis’ (1984, p.44). These studies found a union wage effect on average of 10-15%.
The more recent studies FM examined, including a number of their own, used micro data at the
level of the establishment but more usually at that of the individual. In Table 3.1 FM showed
that the union differential in the 1970s was 20-30% using cross-section data (the 7 numbers in
the table averaged out at 25.3%). Such estimates may still suffer from bias because differences
due to the skills and abilities of workers are wrongly attributed to unions. FM also considered
‘before and after’ comparisons and argued that, although they represent a way to eliminate
ability bias they also suffer from measurement error problems derived from mismeasurement of
the union status measure (Hirsch, 2003). FM reported 12 estimates using panel data in their
Table 3.2 for the 1970s: these are sizable but smaller than the cross-section estimates they
examined, averaging out at 15.7%4.
FM used data from the May 1979 Current Population Survey (CPS) to obtain a series of
disaggregated estimates using a sample of non-agricultural private sector blue-collar workers
aged 20-65. They reported that unions raise wages most for the young, the least tenured, whites,
men, the least educated, blue collar workers and in the largely unorganized South and West5.
Further FM found, using data for 62 industries from the 1973-1975 May CPS that there was
considerable variation in the size of the differential6.
FM argued that the amount of monopoly power held by unions is related to the wage
sensitivity of the demand for organized labor. The smaller response of employment to wages the
greater they argued is the ability of unions to raise wages without significant loss in employment.
Areas where employment is less responsive to wage changes such as air transport they argued
should be where one would expect to find sizable gains.
FM went on to argue that the differential likely depends on the extent to which the union
is able to organize a big percentage of workers – the higher the percentage the higher the
3

differential (p51). FM found that for blue collar workers in manufacturing a 10% increase in
organizing generates a 1.5% increase in union wages. In contrast, they argued that the wages of
nonunion workers do not appear to be influenced by the percentage workers organized. In terms
of the characteristics of firms and plants FM obtained the following results.
a) Union differentials depend on the extent to which the firm bargains for an entire sector rather
than for individual plants within a sector.
b) Wage differentials tend to fall with size of firm/plant/workplace.
c) There was no clear empirical evidence on the relationship between product market power and
differentials primarily as it is so difficult to measure power.
In terms of macro changes in differentials FM found that the 1970s were a period of
increases in the union wage premium. FM conjectured that a possible explanation was the
sluggish labor market conditions prevailing at the time. Wages of union workers, they argued,
tend to be less sensitive to business cycle ups and downs – particularly due to three year
contracts. This implies the union wage premium moves counter-cyclically – high in slumps
when the unemployment rate is high and low in booms when the unemployment is low.
However, FM found that inflation and unemployment explained less than 50% of the rising
union differentials in the 70s. Nor they argued did the rising wage differentials of the 1970s
represent an historical increase in union power. The early 80s according to FM were a period of
‘givebacks’ where unions agreed to wage cuts. Union wage gains, according to FM were NOT a
major cause of inflation.
FM ended chapter three by estimating the social cost of monopoly power of unions. Loss
of output due to unions they found to be ‘quite modest’: accounting for between 0.2% and 0.4%
of GNP or between $5 billion and $10 billion.
FM drew six conclusions on the union wage effect.
4

a) The common sense view that there is a union wage effect is correct.
b) The magnitude of the differential varies among people, markets and time periods.
c) Variation in the union wage gap across people is best understood by union standard rate
policies arising from voice.
d) Variation in the union wage gap across markets is best understood by union monopoly power
and employer product market power.
e) Wage premia of 1970s were substantial but they returned to more ‘normal’ levels in the 1980s.
f) Social loss due to unions is small.
2. Changes in the Labor Market Since WDUD
Union density rates in the US have fallen rapidly from 24% in 1977 to 13% in 2002 (Hirsch and
Macpherson, 2002)7. The decline was most dramatic in the private sector where in 2002 less
than 1 in 10 workers are union members. Density remains higher in manufacturing than in
services. However, Table 1 suggests that union membership has roughly the same disaggregated
pattern in 2001 as it did in 1977 – union density is higher among men than women; for older
versus younger workers; in regions outside the South; and in transportation and communication
and construction. The exceptions are by race, where in 1977 rates were higher among nonwhites but there is little difference by 2001, and by schooling. In 1977 membership rates for
those with below high school education were nearly double those with above high school
education. In 2001 they were approximately the same. So the highly qualified have increased
their share of union employment.
The number of private sector union members declined over the period 1983-2002
whereas the number of public sector union members actually increased (Table 2). Due to the
growth in total employment in the public sector, however, the proportion of public sector
workers who were union members was exactly the same in 2001 and 1983 (37%)8. By 2002,
5

46% of all union members in the US were to be found in the public sector compared with 32.5%
in 1983.
3. Union wage gaps since WDUD
3.1. What has happened to the union wage differential between 1979 and 2001?
Table 3 presents union wage gaps obtained from estimating a series of equations for each of the
major sub-groups examined by FM who used the 1979 May CPS file on a sample of nonagricultural private sector blue-collar workers aged 20-65. Their sample was very small, being
limited to around 6,000 observations. Rather than use the estimates reported by FM to ensure
large sample sizes we decided to pool together 6 successive May CPS files from 1974-1979 and
then compare those to wage gaps estimated for the years 1996-2001 using data from the Matched
Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files of the CPS. Columns 1 and 2 estimate wage gaps for
the private sector for 1996-2001 and 1974-1979 respectively.

Columns 3 and 4 present

equivalent estimates for the sample used by FM of non-agricultural private sector blue-collar
workers aged 20-65.
Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) show a ‘match bias’ in union wage gap estimates due to
earnings imputations9. This bias arises because workers in the CPS have earnings imputed using
a “cell hot deck” method. This means that wage gap estimates are biased downward when the
attribute being studied (e.g. union status) is not a criterion used in the imputation. By construction,
the individuals with imputed earnings have a union wage gap of close to zero; hence omitting
them raises the size of the union wage gap. They show that standard union wage gap estimates
such as reported in Blanchflower (1999) are understated by about 3 to 5 percentage points as a
result of including individuals who have had their earnings imputed.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter to exclude those individuals with imputed
earnings in a consistent way over time10. Here we follow the procedure suggested by Hirsch and
6

Schumacher (2002) and that we used in Blanchflower and Bryson (2003).11 All allocated earners
are identified and excluded for the years 1996-2001 in the MORG files. Because the May CPS
sample files available to us do not report allocated earnings in 1979-81, the series are adjusted
upward by the average bias (of .033) found by Hirsch and Schumacher using these May CPS
data for 1979-81. Earnings were not allocated in the years 1973-1978. For the period 1973-1979
total sample size was approximately 184,000 compared with 547,000 for the later period. In
each year from 1996-2001 there are approximately 130,000 observations for the private sector in
the MORG; in the May files, sample sizes are approximately 31,000.
Comparing FM’s sample and the wider private sector sample for the 1970s (columns 4
and 2 respectively in Table 3), FM’s sample generates a larger wage gap for all, with the
exception of the least educated12. The difference between the two samples is large, with the FM
sample generating a premium for the whole private sector which is a third larger (28% as
opposed to 21%) than in the wider sample. However, patterns in the wage gaps across workers
are similar.
a) By sex, there is little difference in the size of the gap.
b) By age, the union effect is U-shaped in age and largest among the youngest who tend to be
the lowest paid
c) By tenure, the pattern is a similar U-shape.
d) By education, unions raise wages most for the least educated, with the most highly educated
having the lowest premium.
e) By race, unions raise wages by a similar amount for whites and non-whites.
f) By occupation, although not reported in column 4, FM (1984: 49-50) report larger gains for
blue-collar than for white-collar workers. The manual/non-manual gap in column 2 bears this
out.
7

g) By region, unions had the largest effects in the relatively unorganized South and West, with
more modest effects in the relatively well organized Northeast.
h) By industry, Construction and Services have the highest premia.
What has happened since the 1970s?
i) By sex, the wage gap has declined for women, but remained roughly stable for men so that, by
the late 1990s, the union wage gap was higher for men than for women. The rate of decline in
women’s union premium is underestimated in FM’s restricted sample, but is still apparent.
j) By age, the U-shaped relationship apparent in the 1970s has disappeared because there has
been a precipitous decline in the premium for the youngest workers, while older workers’ wage
gap has remained roughly constant. In the full private sector sample, young workers still benefit
most from union wage bargaining, though this is not apparent in FM’s restricted sample.
k) By tenure, as in the case of age, the U-shaped relationship between tenure and the union
premium apparent in the 1970s has disappeared, because low and high tenured workers have
seen their wage gap fall substantially while middle-tenure workers have experienced a stable
union wage gap. Now, it seems the premium declines with tenure.
l) By education, the lowest educated continue to benefit most from union wage bargaining, but
not to the same degree as in the 1970s. Although the trend is not so apparent in FM’s sample,
the wage gap has fallen most for high-school drop-outs
m)

By race, a three percentage point gap has opened up between the union premium

commanded by non-whites and the lower premium for whites
n) By occupation, the union premium has collapsed for non-manual workers. Despite some
decline in the premium for manuals, their wage gap was 17 percentage points larger than that for
non-manuals by the late 1990s (compared with only 5 percentage points in the 1970s)

8

o) By region, the wage gap remains largest in the West and the South though, in FM’s sample,
there is no difference in the premium in the South and Central regions. The wage gap remains
smallest in the Northeast.
p) By industry, the wage gap remains largest in Construction and smallest in Manufacturing.
The decline in the differential was particularly marked in Services. We return to industry
differentials later
Two points stand out from these analyses. First, no group of workers in the broader
private sector sample has experienced a substantial increase in their union premium. Indeed,
the only group recording any increase at all is those aged 45-54 who see their premium rise from
13% to 14%. Clearly, unions have found it harder to maintain a wage gap since FM wrote.
Second, with the exception of the manual/non-manual gap, those with the highest premiums in
the 1970s saw the biggest falls, so there has been some convergence in the size of wage gaps.
This finding is apparent whether we compare trends using FM’s sample (columns 3 and 4) or the
broader private sector sample (columns 1 and 2). This trend may be due to an increasingly
competitive US economy, where workers commanding wages well above the market rate are
subject to intense competition from non-union workers. Nevertheless, with the exception of the
most highly educated and non-manual workers, the wage premium remains around 10% or more.
3.2. Public sector
FM said little or nothing on the role of unions in the public sector, although, as noted above,
Freeman has subsequently written voluminously on the issue. Given that the remaining bastion
of unionism in the US is now in the public sector, it is likely if FM were writing today they
would have devoted a considerable amount of space in a twenty-first century edition of WDUD
to the public sector. So we did some of it for them: more evidence on how the role of unions in

9

the public sector since WDUD was written is presented by Morley Gunderson in another chapter
in this volume.
It is apparent from Table 2 above that the size of the public sector grew (from 15.6
million to 19.1 million or 22.4%) over the period 1983-2001 but as a proportion of total
employment it fell from 18.0% to 16.1%. Union membership in the public sector grew even
more rapidly (from 5.7 million to 7.1 million or by 24.6%). As we noted earlier, by 2001 public
sector unions accounted for 44% of all union members compared with 32.5% in 1983.
Table 4 is comparable to Table 3 above for the private sector in that it presents
disaggregated union wage gap estimates. Because sample sizes in the public sector are small
using the May CPS files we once again decided to use data from the ORG files of the CPS for
the years 1983-1988 for comparison purposes with the 1996-2001 data. It was not possible to
use data for the years 1979-1982 as no union data are available. A further advantage of using the
1983-1988 data is that information is available on those individuals whose earnings were
allocated who were then excluded from the analysis. The main findings are as follows.
1) The private sector union wage gap has fallen over the two periods (21.5% to 17.0%) whereas
a slight increase was observed in the public sector (13.3% to 14.5% respectively).
2) The majority of the worker groups in Table 4 experienced increases in the size of their union
wage premium over the two periods, but wage gaps declined markedly for those under 25 and
with less than a high school education.
3) There was little change in public sector union wage gaps for men or women. In marked
contrast to the private sector where men had higher differentials than women, wage gaps in both
periods in the public sector were higher for women than for men.
4) Unions benefit workers most in local government and least in the federal government although
the differential for federal workers increased over time.13
10

5) Just as was found for the private sector, the wage benefits of union membership are greatest
for manual workers, the young and the least educated.
6) There are only small differences in union wage gaps for non-whites compared to whites in
both the public and the private sectors.
7) In contrast to the private sector where wage differentials were greatest in the South and West,
in the public sector exactly the opposite is found. Higher differentials are found in the public
sector in New England and the Central region in both time periods whereas the reverse was the
case in the private sector.
8) Wage gaps increased over time for teachers, lawyers, firefighters and police.
3.3 Immigrants14
FM also said nothing about the extent to which labor unions in the US are able to sign up
immigrants as members and then by how much they are able to raise their wages. Using the data
available in the CPS files since the mid-1990s we calculate wage gaps for the period 19962001.We find little variation in union wage gaps by length of time the immigrant had been in the
US, holding characteristics constant as well as wage gaps for the US born. However, differentials
by source country are large. Differentials for Europeans (11.6% for Western Europe and 12.7%
for Eastern Europe) are well below those of the native born (16.8%). Estimates are also in low
double digits for Asians, Africans and South Americans (13.3%, 11% and 12.2% respectively).
In contrast the wage gap for Mexicans is 28%.
4. Time series changes in the union wage gap.
FM reported that the 1970s was a period of rising differentials for unions, although they did not
separately estimate year by year results themselves. Table 5, which is taken from Blanchflower
and Bryson (2003) and is reproduced by permission15, reports adjusted estimates of the wage gap
using separate log hourly earnings equations for each of the years from 1973 to 1981 using the
11

National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER) May Earnings Supplements to the CPS
(CPS)16 and for the years since then using data from the NBER’s (MORG) files of the CPS17.
The MORG data for the years 1983-1995 were previously used in Blanchflower (1999)18. For
both the May and the MORG files a broadly similar, but not identical, list of control variables is
used, including a union status dummy, age and its square, a gender dummy, education, race and
hours controls plus state and industry dummies19.
The first column of Table 5 reports time-consistent estimates of union wage gaps for the
total sample while the second and third columns report them for the private sector. To solve the
match bias problem discussed above, as we did in Tables 3 and 4 we followed the procedure
suggested by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) and described in the footnote to Table 5. Results
obtained by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) with a somewhat different set of controls are
reported in the final column of the table. For a discussion of the reason for these differences see
Blanchflower and Bryson (2003). The time series properties of all three of the series are
essentially the same.
The wage gap averages between 17 and 18 per cent over the period, and is similar in size
in the private sector as it is in the economy as a whole. The table confirms FM’s comment (1984:
53) that ‘the late 1970s appear to have been a period of substantial increase in the union wage
premium’. What is notable is the high differential in the early to mid 1980s and a slight decline
thereafter, which gathers pace after 1995, with the series picking up again as the economy started
to turn down in 2000.
Table 6 presents estimates of both the unadjusted and adjusted union wage gaps for the
private sector. The sample excludes individuals with imputed earnings. In column 1 of the
Table we report the results of estimating a series of wage equations by year that only include a
union dummy as a control. These numbers are consequently different from those reported by
12

Hirsch and Macpherson (2002, Table 2a) who report raw unadjusted wage differences between
the union and non-union sectors but do not exclude individuals with imputed earnings20.
Throughout the unadjusted wage gap is higher than the adjusted wage gap, implying a positive
association between union membership and wage enhancing employee and/or employer
characteristics. However, the unadjusted gap has declined more rapidly than the regressionadjusted gap since 1983. In 1983 the unadjusted estimate was 128% higher than the adjusted
estimate: in 2002 the difference had fallen to 91.5% higher.
To establish what is driving this effect, Hirsch, Macpherson and Schumacher (2002)
decompose the unadjusted wage gap into its three components – employment shifts, changes in
worker characteristics, and in the residual union wage premium. Using CPS data for the private
sector only, they find almost half (46%) of the decline in the union-nonunion log wage gap over
the period 1986-2001 is accounted for by a decline in the regression-adjusted wage gap. Sixteen
per cent of the decline is accounted for by changes in worker characteristics and payoffs to those
characteristics, chief among these being the increase in the union relative to nonunion percentage
of female workers. The remaining 38% of the decline in the unadjusted wage gap Hirsch,
Macpherson and Schumacher found was due to sectoral shifts and payoffs to the sectors workers
are located in. The sectoral changes that stand out are the substantial decline in union relative to
nonunion employment in durable manufacturing, and the decline in relative pay (that is, the
industry coefficient) in Transportation, Communications and Utilities, a sector with a large share
of total union employment.
The results reported in Table 5 are broadly comparable to the estimates obtained by H.
Gregg Lewis (1986) in his Table 9.7, which summarized the findings of 165 studies for the
period 1967-79.

Lewis concluded that during this period the US mean wage gap was

approximately 15 per cent. His results are reported below21:

The left panel contains estimates for the six years prior to our starting point in Table 5. It does
appear that the unweighted average for this first period, 1967-72, of 14 per cent is slightly below
the 16% for the second interval, 1973-79. The estimates for the later period are very similar to
those we obtained in Table 5 – which also averaged 16 per cent – and have the same time-series
pattern. In part, the low number Lewis obtained for 1979 is explained by the fact that the 1979
May CPS file included allocated earners and hence the estimates were not adjusted for the
downward bias caused by the imputation of the earnings data22.
Figure 1 plots the point estimates of the union wage premium for the US, taken from the
first column of Table 5, against unemployment for 1973-2002. The premium moves countercyclically.

There are three main factors likely influencing the degree of counter-cyclical

movement in the wage gap. The first, cited by FM (1984: 52-53) as the reason for the widening
wage gap during the Depression of the 1920s and 1930s, is the greater capacity for unionized
workers to ‘fight employer efforts to reduce wages’ when market conditions are unfavorable.
Conversely, when demand for labor is strong, employees are less reliant on unions to bargain for
better wages because market rates rise anyway. The second factor is the fact that union contracts
are more long-term than non-union ones and, as such, less responsive to the economic cycle.
This means that union wages respond to economic conditions with a lag.
When inflation is higher than expected, this can result in a greater contraction in the
premium because non-union wages are more responsive to higher inflation. However, the third
factor, which should reduce the cyclical sensitivity of the union wage premium, is the cost-of14

living-adjustment (COLA) clauses in union contracts that increase union wages in response to
changes in the consumer price level. According to FM (1984: 54) the percentage of union
workers covered by these agreements rose dramatically in the 1970s, from 25% at the beginning
of the decade to 60% at the end of the decade. However, FM’s estimates for manufacturing
suggest that COLA provisions ‘contributed only a modest amount to the rising union advantage’
in the 1970s. Bratsberg and Ragan (2002) revisit this issue and find the increased sensitivity of
the premium to the cycle is due in part to reduced COLA coverage from the late 1980s, but we
find no such evidence (see below).
Commenting on the growth of the union wage premium during the 1970s, FM (1984: 54)
suggested that “at least in several major sectors the union/nonunion differential reached levels
inconsistent with the survival of many union jobs”. They were right. In the 1970s and early
1980s, the wage gap in the private sector rose while union density fell, as predicted in the
standard textbook model of the way that employment responds to wages where the union has
monopoly power over labor supply. In the classic monopoly model, demand for labor is given,
so a rise in the union premium will result in a decline in union membership since the premium
hits employment. The fact that unions pushed for, and got, an increasing wage premium over
this period, implies that they were willing to sustain membership losses to maintain real wages,
or that unions were simply unaware of the consequences of their actions.
From the mid-1990s, the continued decline in union density was accompanied by a
falling union wage premium. This occurred because demand for union labor fell as a result of
two pressures. The first was increasing competitiveness throughout the US economy: increasing
price competition in markets generally meant employers were less able to pass the costs of the
premium onto the consumer, so that pressures for wages to conform to the market rate grew.
Secondly, unionized companies faced greater nonunion competition. Declining union density, by
15

increasing employers’ opportunities to substitute non-union products for union products, fuelled
this process.

So too did rising import penetration: if imports are non-union goods, then

regardless of union density in the US, they increase the opportunity for non-union substitution.
These same pressures also increased the employment price of any union wage gap (what
economists call the elasticity of demand for unionized labor).
5. Industry, occupation and state-level wage premia
So far, we have focused primarily on union wage effects at the level of the individual and the
whole economy. However, the literature on the origins of the union wage premium focuses
largely on firms and industries. This is because the conventional assumption is that unions can
procure a wage premium by capturing quasi-rents from the employer (see Blanchflower, Oswald
and Sanfey, 1996 for more on this). If this is so, there must be rents available to the firm arising
from their position in the market place, and unions must have the ability to capture some of these
rents through their ability to monopolize the supply of labor to the firm. Individual-level data
can tell us little about these processes. Instead, the literature has concentrated on industry-level
wage gaps. In this section we model the change in the union wage premium at three different
units of observation - industry, state and occupation.
5.1. Industries.
As we noted above FM reported wage gap estimates by the extent of industry unionism. They
(1984: 50) comment on substantial variation in the union wage effect by industry, with gaps
ranging between 5% and 35% in the CPS data for 1973-75. FM’s results are reported in the first
column below. We used our data to estimate separate results by two digit industry for 19831988 and 1996-2001. We chose these years as it was possible to define industries identically
using the 1980 industry classification. Using these data we also found considerable variation by
the size of the wage gap by industry.

There is less variation in the wage gap by industry in the later period than in the earlier period
with only 3 industries, construction (41%), transport (36%) and repair services (37%) having a
differential of over 35%, compared with 6 in the earlier period which includes the same three construction (52%); transport (44%); repair services (37%) – plus agricultural services (41%);
other agriculture (56%) and entertainment (47%).23
Where is the union wage premium rising, and where is it falling? The details are
presented in Table 7. It shows the regression-adjusted wage gaps in 44 industries during the
1980s (1983-1988) and then in the late 1990s (1996-2001). In contrast to the analysis by worker
characteristics, which reveal near universal decline in the premium – at least in the private sector
– it shows the wage gap rose in 17 industries and declined in 27. The gap rose by more than ten
percentage points in autos (+12%) and leather (+19%).

It declined by more than twenty

percentage points in other agriculture (-33%) retail trade (-20%) and private households (-29%).
Table 7 also shows that many of the industries experiencing a rise in the union premium between
1983 and 2001 would have been subject to intensifying international trade (Machinery, Electrical
Equipment, Paper, Rubber and Plastics, Leather) but this is equally true for those experiencing
declining premiums (such as Textiles, Apparel and Furniture). Horn (1998) found that increases
in import competition led to increases in union density and decreases in the wage premium
within manufacturing industries. This occurred because union density fell slower than overall
employment when faced with import competition. Horn also found that imports from OECD
countries decreased union density, while imports from non-OECD countries tended to raise
union density within an industry.
17

There is a negative correlation between change in union density and change in the
premium (correlation coefficient –0.39). Some of the biggest declines in the premium have been
concentrated in the sectors where the bulk of private sector union members are concentrated, as
the table below indicates. It shows the only three industries with more than a 10% share in
private sector union membership in 2002. In Construction and Transport, which both make up
an increasing proportion of all private sector union members, the premium fell by around 10
percentage points. In Retail Trade, where the share of private sector union membership has
remained roughly constant at 10%, the premium fell 20 percentage points.

The decline in the wage gap for the whole economy, presented earlier, is due to the fact that the
industries experiencing a decline in their wage gap make up a higher percentage of all employees
than those experiencing a widening gap. The results are similar to those presented by Bratsberg
and Ragan (2002). They find that, over the period 1971-1999, the regression-adjusted wage gap
closed in 16 industries and increased in 16 others. Their analysis is not directly comparable to
ours, but where industry-level changes are presented in both studies, they tend to trend in the
same direction. Only in one industry (Transport Equipment) do Bratsberg and Ragan report a
significant increase in the wage gap where we find a decline in the wage gap.
These changes in the union wage premium by industry over time are worth detailed
investigation, even though FM did not present such analyses. Our first step was to estimate 855
separate first-stage regressions, one for each of our 45 industries in each year from 1983-2001
with the dependent variable the log hourly wage along with controls for union membership, age,
age squared, male, 4 race dummies, the log of hours and 50 state dummies. The sample was
18

restricted to the private sector and excluded all individuals with allocated earnings. Three sectors
with very small sample sizes (toys, tobacco and forestry and fisheries) were deleted. We
extracted the coefficient on the union variable, giving us 19 years * 42 industries or 798
observations in all. The adjustments discussed earlier were made to deal with imputed earnings.
The coefficient on the union variable was then turned into a wage gap taking anti-logs, deducting
1 and multiplying by 100 to turn it into a percentage. We used the ORG files to estimate the
proportion of workers in the industry who were union members both in the private sector and
overall and mapped that onto the file. Unemployment rates at the level of the economy are used
as industry specific rates are not meaningful: workers move a great deal between industries and
considerably more than they do between states.

(A table providing information on the

classification of industries used and the average number of observations each year is available on
request from the authors). Regression results, reported in Table 8, columns 1 and 2, estimate the
impact of the lagged premium, lagged unemployment and a time trend on the level of the
industry-level wage premium. The number of observations is 756 as we lose 42 observations in
generating the lag on the wage premium and the union density variables.
In the unweighted equation in column (1) we find the lagged premium is positively and
significantly associated with the level of the premium the following year indicating regression to
the mean. Unemployment and the time trend are not significant. However, once the regression
is weighted by the number of observations in the industry in the first stage regression, (column
(2)) lagged unemployment is positive and significant, indicating counter-cyclical movement in
the premium, while the negative time trend indicates secular decline in the premium.
Bratsberg and Ragan (2002) reported that the industry-level premium was influenced by a
number of other variables.24 In particular they found that COLA clauses reduced the cyclicality
of the union premium and that increases in import penetration were strongly associated with
19

rising union premiums25. They also found some evidence that industry deregulation had mixed
effects. Their main equations (their Table 2) did not include a lagged dependent variable. Table
9 reports results using their data for the years 1973-1999 using their method and computer
programs that they kindly provided to us. Column 1 of the Table reports the results they reported
in column 2 of their Table 2. Column 2 reports our attempt to replicate their findings. We are
unable to do so exactly – the problem appears to arise from the use of the xtgls routine in
STATA which gives different results on our two machines26. There are several similarities – we
find import penetration both in durables and non-durables, COLA clauses, deregulations in
communications and the unemployment rate all have positive and significant effects. We also
found as they did that deregulation in Finance lowered the premium. In contrast to Bratsberg
and Ragan, however, the inflation rate and the two interaction terms with the unemployment rate
were insignificant. The model is rerun in column 3, but without the insignificant interaction
term. A linear time trend is added in column 4: this is negative and significant, and eliminates
the COLA effect and the negative effect of deregulation in the finance sector. Column 5 adds the
lagged union wage premium, which is positive and significant. Its introduction makes inflation
positive and significant. In columns (6) to (8) models are run without the four insignificant
deregulation dummies. Column (6) indicates that, using an unweighted regression, the size of
the lagged premium effect drops markedly and the time trend and inflation lose significance,
showing these results are sensitive to the weighting of the regression. The smaller coefficient on
the lagged dependent variable is unsurprising given that there is much less likely to be variation
in the union wage gap estimates in industries with large sample sizes that have higher weights in
the former case. We are able to confirm Bratsberg and Ragan’s finding that the unemployment
rate, deregulation in Communications and import penetration in both durables and non-durables

20

have positive impacts on the premium but not the findings on COLA, inflation or any of the
other deregulations identified.
The fact that we find import penetration in durable and non-durable goods sectors
increases the premium suggests that union wages are more resilient than non-union wages to
foreign competition. Import penetration is likely correlated with unmeasured industry
characteristics that depress the premium inducing a negative bias that is removed once industry
characteristics are controlled for. Import penetration has likely reduced demand for union and
non-union labor, with union wages holding up better than non-union wages, but at the expense of
reduced union employment. There are theoretical and empirical reasons as to why this might
occur. For instance, since union wages tend to be less responsive to market conditions generally,
it may be that union wages are sluggish in responding to increased competition from imports.
Alternatively, industries characterized by ‘end-game’ bargaining may witness perverse union
responses to shifts in product demand as the union tries to extract maximum rents in declining
industries (Lawrence and Lawrence, 1985).

Another possibility is that increased import

penetration reduces the share of union employment in labor intensive firms, increasing it in
capital intensive firms. Greater capital intensity reduces elasticity of demand for union labor,
allowing rent maximising unions to raise the premium (Staiger, 1988).
It isn’t obvious that weights should be used if we regard each industry as a separate
observation. In cross-country comparisons which, say compared outcomes for Switzerland, the
UK and the US it wouldn’t make a lot of sense to weight by population and thereby make the
observation from the US 4.67 times more important than that of the UK and 39.3 times more
important than Switzerland27. Columns (1) to (6) are GLS estimates accounting for potential
correlation in error terms. Column (7) switches to a weighted OLS and shows results are not
sensitive to the switch. The unweighted OLS in column (8) gives broadly the same results as the
21

unweighted GLS in column (6). Taking off the weights has a much bigger impact than switching
from GLS to OLS.
Further, the industries defined by Bratsberg and Ragan are very different in size. Some
industries are very broadly defined – for example industry 32 Services covers SIC codes 721-900
while Tobacco, for example covers one SIC code #130.

Retail Trade averaged 19,075

observations. Column 9 of Table 9 illustrates the sensitivity of the results to industry exclusions.
It is exactly equivalent in all respects to column 5 of the Table except that it drops the 32
observations from Retail Trade. The lagged dependent variable falls dramatically from .60 to
.32. The COLA variable is now significantly positive while the inflation variable moves from
being significantly positive to insignificant. The unweighted results (not reported) are little
changed. Bratsberg and Ragan’s results appear to be sensitive to both the use of weights and the
sample of industries used.
5.2. States
In the US unions are geographically concentrated by town, county, district and state. Often
towns next to each other differ – one is a union town, the other is non-union. Waddoups (2000)
used this interesting juxtaposition of union and non-union zones to estimate the impact of unions
on wages in Nevada’s hotel-casino industry.28 Although they share many features, and are
subject to broadly similar business cycles, most of the 51 states in the US are comparable in size
and economic significance to many countries. They also differ markedly in their industrial
structures and unionization rates. Assuming union density proxies union bargaining power, this
implies different premiums across states.

However, as noted earlier, FM found the union

premium at regional level was inversely correlated with union density, with the premium highest
in the relatively unorganized South and West. To explore this issue further, and to assess
changes over time, we estimated separate wage gaps for two time periods at the level of the 50
22

states plus Washington DC. Results at the level of the state are reported in Table 10, and are
summarized in the table below. The data used are from the Outgoing Rotation Group files of the
CPS. It was not possible to identify each state separately in the May CPS so FM did not report
such results. Hence, we compared results from a merged sample of the 1983-1988 with those
obtained from our 1996-2001 files. The penultimate column in the table presents changes in
union density in the each state.29 The correlation between changes in state density and state
premia is negative but small (-0.10).

The first thing we notice is that the variation in the union wage premium is much less by state
than it is by industry. Only two states in the earlier period had gaps of at least 35% - North
Dakota (35%) and Nebraska (37%) and none in the later period. There has been a downward
shift in the premium generally, as indicated by the movement from the 15-35% category to the 515% category. The mean state union wage gap was 23.4% between 1983 and 1988, falling by
6.2 percentage points to 17.2% in 1996-2001. The premium fell in all but five states, with South
Dakota recording the biggest decline (16.8 percentage points). In four of the five states where
the premium rose, it only increased by a percentage point or two (Vermont, Massachusetts,
Wyoming, Hawaii). The premium only rose markedly in Maine, where it increased 9 percentage
points (from 7% to 16.1%). Since the early 1980s, union density fell by an average of 5.7
percentage points, with Pennsylvania (-10.6%) and West Virginia experiencing the biggest
decline (-11 percentage points). The premium appears to have declined more in smaller states
than it has in bigger states.

It is apparent from Table 10 that the five biggest states of

California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois had small changes in their wage gaps (-1.4%; 23

6.7%;

-10.1%; –0.6% and –4.5% respectively).

The five smallest states measured by

employment tended to have big declines in the differentials: New Mexico (-14.10%); Alabama (14.20%); Nebraska (-15.00%); Arkansas (-15.20%); South Dakota (-16.80%).30.
We then ran 969 separate first-stage regressions, one for each state in each year from
1983-2001 with the dependent variable the log hourly wage along with controls for union
membership, age, age squared, male, 4 race dummies, the log of hours and 44 industry dummies.
The sample was restricted to the private sector and allocated earnings were dealt with as
described earlier. We extracted the coefficient on the union variable, giving us 19 years * 51
states (including D.C.) or 969 observations in all.

We then mapped to that file the

unemployment rate in the state year cell31. Once again we ran a series of second-stage
regressions where the dependent variable is the one year change in the premium (obtained by
taking anti-logs of the union coefficient and deducting one) on a series of RHS variables
including the lagged premium and lagged unemployment and union density rates32. Results are
reported in columns (3) and (4) of Table 8. The number of observations is 918 as we lose 51
observations in generating the lag on the wage premium and the union density variables. Both
unweighted and weighted results are presented where the weights are total employment in the
state by year. Controlling for state fixed effects with 50 state dummies we find that, with an
unweighted regression (column (3)) the lagged premium is positive and significant, as it was at
industry-level. Again, as in the case of industry-level analysis, the effect is apparent when
weighting the regression (column (4)). The positive, significant effect of lagged state-level
unemployment confirms the counter-cyclical nature of the premium: the effect is apparent
whether the regression is weighted or not. There is also evidence of a secular decline in the
state-level premium, but only where the regression is unweighted.

24

State fixed effects account for state-level variance in union density where the effect is
fixed over time. However, Farber (2003) argues that there remain potential unobserved variables
which simultaneously determine density and wages, but which are time-varying, and thus not
picked up in fixed effects, which might bias our results.
5.3. Occupations
Finally, we moved on to estimate wage gaps at the level of the occupation. Results are reported
in Table 11 using the same samples used as we did above – pooling six years of data 1983-1988
and 1996-2001 files from the Outgoing Rotation Group files of the CPS. As we found with our
estimates by industry there is considerable variation by occupation both in the first period and
the second: the variation is greater than was found when the analysis was conducted at the level
of states. In the first period 11 occupations had wage gaps over 35% - primarily manual
occupations. In the second 7 of these occupations still had gaps of over 35%.

Out of the 44 groups 13 showed increases in the size of the differential over time while the
remainder had decreases. We used the same method described above for industries and states,
with occupations defined in a comparable way through time.

Columns (5) and (6) of Table 8

show that, whether the occupation-level analysis is weighted or not, there is clear evidence of
regression to the mean, with the lagged premium positive and significant, as well as evidence of
a secular decline in the premium. A significant counter-cyclical effect is evident when the
regression is weighted, but not in the unweighted regression.
In all three units of observation we have used – industry, state and occupation – there is
evidence that the private sector premium moves counter-cyclically and that it has been declining
25

over time. In all three cases the lagged level of the premium entered significantly positively and
was larger when the weights were used than when they were not. The size of the lag was
greatest when industries were used as the unit of observation and least when occupations were
used. Translating the results from levels into changes – that is by deducting t-1 from both sides –
leaves all of the other coefficients unchanged. Using the weighted results in Table 7 the results
reported below imply mean convergence.

The higher the level of the premium in the previous period the lower the change in the next
period.
6. What have we learned and would FM have been surprised about these results when they
wrote WDUD?
6.1. The private sector wage premium is lower today than it was in the 1970s.
This would not have surprised FM. Indeed, they predicted that the premiums of the 1970s were
unsustainable due to their impact on union density (FM 1984: 54). Perhaps it is surprising that
the premium remains as high as it does? One possibility is that, even though union bargaining
power has declined, union density continues to decline, implying that there is some employment
spillover into the non-union sector. If wage setting in the non-union sector is more flexible than
it used to be, this additional supply of labor to the non-union sector may depress non-union
wages more so than in the past, keeping the premium higher than anticipated.
6.2. The union wage premium is counter-cyclical.
The decline in the premium in good times is what seems to explain much of the decline in the
premium since the mid-1990s. Far from being a surprise to FM, they identified the countercyclical nature of the premium.

We show the premium is counter-cyclical at the state,

occupation and industry levels. FM said COLA’s could dampen counter-cyclical movements in
26

the premium, but thought their significance had been overplayed. This is confirmed: we find no
COLA effect, though this finding is contested by others.
6.3. There is evidence of a secular decline in the private sector union wage premium.
There is evidence at state, industry and occupation level of a downward trend in the private
sector union wage premium accompanying the marked decline in union presence in the private
sector. The effect is sensitive to weighting in the case of the state-level and industry-level
premia, but not in the case of the occupational premia. Interestingly the wage gap appears to
have declined most in the smallest states (e.g. New Mexico, Alabama, Nebraska, Arkansas,
South Dakota) and declined least in the bigger states (e.g. California, Texas, New York; Illinois).
It would not have been a surprise to FM that there had been some reduction in the ability of
unions over time to raise wages as the proportion of the workforce they bargain for has declined.
6.4. There remains big variation in the premium across workers.
Patterns in the premium across worker types resemble those found by FM. The FM sub-sample
generally overstated the size of the premium in the population as a whole but we suspect this
would not have surprised FM. A decline in the premium over time seems to have occurred
across all demographic characteristics in the private sector, but there is regression to the mean,
the biggest losers being among the most vulnerable and certainly the lowest paid workers (the
young, women, high school dropouts). But perhaps the real surprise is just how large the
premium still is for some of these workers (26% for high school dropouts, 19% for under 25s).
One puzzle is the remarkable rise in the share of union employment taken by the highly
qualified, yet they continue to receive the lowest union premium. Why? Do they look for
something else from their unions, eg. professional indemnity insurance or voice, or are their
unions less effective? In contrast to the private sector, the public sector has experienced a small
increase in the premium, an increase apparent for most public sector employees. It is a sector
27

where industry-level bargaining remains the norm, maintaining union bargaining power. So,
perhaps FM would not have been surprised by this result. We look at one group of workers that
FM did not consider: immigrants. The premium varies little by year of entry to the US, but does
depend on the country of birth, with Mexicans benefiting from the highest premium. Whether
this reflects the human capital, occupational mix, or costs of immigration faced by different
groups is a matter for further research, but we suspect the results would not have surprised FM.
6.5. There is big variation in industry-level union wage premia.
FM also found wide variation in industry-level premiums, and might have expected this to
persist because unions’ ability to push for a premium, and employers’ ability to pay, is
determined by industry-specific factors (such as union organization and the availability of nonunion labor, regulatory regimes, bargaining, product market rents).

However, we find

convergence in industry-level premiums since FM wrote, that is, a falling premium where it was
once large, and a rising premium where it was once small. (Overall decline at the economy level
is due to the fact that the former constitute a larger share of employment than the latter). FM
may well have been surprised by this regression to the mean because in 40% of the industries we
examined there was a rise in the premium.
6.6. State level union wage premia vary less than occupation and industry level premia.
FM did not explicitly compare variations in the premia at the state and industry levels. Richard
Freeman expressed the view to us that it made sense to him that there would be more variation at
the occupation and industry levels as they are more closely approximated to markets. No
surprise here.
6.7. Union workers remain better able than non-union workers to resist employer efforts to
reduce wages when market conditions are unfavorable.

28

Import penetration is a good proxy for competition in the traded goods sector. Although the
impact of imports on the US wage distribution is often overstated (Blanchflower, 2000a), it may
be expected to play a role where imports permit substitution of union products for non-union
products. If imports reduce demand for domestic output and, in turn, demand for labor, this
should reduce union and non-union wages (assuming the supply of non-union labor is not
perfectly elastic). Whether the premium rises or falls with increased import penetration depends
on the relative responsiveness of union and non-union wages to demand shifts resulting from
foreign competition. Unions’ ability to resist employer efforts to reduce wages when market
conditions are unfavorable was cited as one reason for the counter-cyclical premium by FM
(1984: 52-53).
6.8. There has been a decline in the unadjusted wage gap relative to the regression-adjusted
wage gap.
Union members do have wage-enhancing advantages over non-members, but these have
diminished in recent years, implying changes in the selection of employees into membership. It
is unlikely that FM would have predicted this.
7. The policy implications
In spite of – or perhaps because of – the inexorable decline in union membership since FM
wrote, and despite some evidence of a recent secular decline in the premium, the union wage
premium in the US remains substantial, and is substantial by international standards
(Blanchflower and Bryson, 2003).

How should US policy analysts treat this piece of

information: should policy support unions or make life more difficult for them?
From a standard economic perspective a substantial union premium has to be bad news:
in bargaining on their members’ behalf unions distort market wage setting, resulting in a loss of
economic efficiency.

This may have consequences for jobs and investment for the firms
29

involved, and potential impacts for the economy as a whole in terms of inflation and output.
However, it is not obvious that markets do operate in the textbook competitive fashion, so there
may indeed be rents available that employers are at liberty to share with workers. Furthermore,
there is evidence – confirmed in this paper – that unions are particularly good at protecting the
wages of the most vulnerable workers. If the most vulnerable are receiving less than their
marginal product – and, perhaps, even if they are receiving it – there may be moral and ethical
grounds for supporting unions. Finally, whether analysts like it or not there is substantial unmet
demand for union representation in the US33. People aren’t getting what they want, raising the
question of whether policy should be deployed to assist unions to organize.
FM found the union premium effect on output was modest, and inflation effects were
negligible. There is no reason to alter this judgment. However, the size of the social costs of
unionization requires an answer to a fundamental, unanswered question, namely: where does the
premium originate? FM assume that it necessarily originates in the monopoly rents of employers
in privileged market positions, although there are at least three possibilities:
1) unions increase the size of the pie because unionized workers are more productive than like
workers in a non-unionized environment,
2) unions operate in firms with excess profits arising from a privileged market position (this may
arise either because unions only seek to organize where there are excess profits available, or
because these sorts of employers have something particular to gain in contracting with unions),
3) the premium is simply a tax on normal profits.
It really matters which of these three options it is. If 1) is true then there’s no implication for
workplace survival or union density, indeed, if this were the case, one might expect a growth in
unionization as firms recognize the advantages in unionizing. If it’s 2) then there is limited
damage, but with 3) there are real problems for firms, with potential knock-on effects for
30

investment, jobs and prices. Of course, different employers may be in different positions at any
point in time and the weight attached to the three options may differ over time with the business
cycle, structural change in the economy and so on. What evidence is there on the above? Barry
Hirsch, in his chapter for this volume, covers these issues in some detail. Here we focus on some
key points.
i) FM (1984: 54) speculate that, at least in some areas, the wage gap has ‘reached levels
inconsistent with the survival of many union jobs’. Blanchflower and Freeman (1992) take this
issue further and argue that the levels of the union wage differential were so high this gave
incentives to employers to remove the union – the benefits of removing the unions appeared to
outweigh the costs. Well, what has happened to union jobs? There is a growing body of
evidence that employment growth rates are lower in the unionized sector, suggesting 2) and or
3). The evidence is for the U.S. (Leonard, 1992), Canada (Long, 1993), Australia (Wooden and
Hawke, 2000) and Britain (Blanchflower, Millward and Oswald, 1991; Bryson, 2001). However,
Freeman and Kleiner (1999) and DiNardo and Lee (2001) find no clear link between
unionization and closure. Indeed, FM record instances in which union workers accepted cuts in
normal wages (‘givebacks’), sometimes to keep employers in business.
ii) Unionization is more common where employers operate in monopolistic or oligopolistic
product markets, suggesting that unions do try to extract surplus rents.
iii) The premium falls when one accounts for workplace heterogeneity. The implication is that
some of the premium usually attached to membership is, in fact, due to unionized workplaces
paying higher wages than non-unionized workplaces. If this is so, why? Perhaps unions target
organization efforts on workplaces that have rents to share, as noted above, they would be
foolish not to.

Or employers use unions as agents to deliver lower quit rates to recoup

investment in human capital (which makes them more productive/profitable). Abowd, Kramarz
31

and Margolis (1999) say higher paying firms are more profitable and/or more productive than
other firms. If this is so for unionized firms, they are operating at a higher level of performance
than other firms. It makes sense that unions are located in higher performing workplaces since,
despite higher wages and a negative union effect on performance, they continue to survive, albeit
with slower employment growth rates. A central thesis of WDUD was that unions were more
productive so this would not be a surprise to FM.
iv) The evidence that unions have a substantial negative impact on employment growth suggests
that the social cost of unions may be larger than FM calculated. If the premium reduces the
competitiveness of unionized firms, they’ll lose employees and, as a consequence, union
organizing will get tougher for unions. This is exactly what has happened. On the other hand, if
unions do not command a premium, they lose their best selling point for prospective customers.
It’s Catch 22.
From a public policy perspective, it is not obvious from this evidence that unions, taken
as a whole, operate to the detriment of the economy or, if they do, that the magnitude of the
problem is really that great. Even the evidence on slower employment growth rates is open to
the criticism that the link is not causal but arises because unions are often located in declining
sectors. What is lacking from the discussion above is a realization that unions and their effects
are heterogeneous: taking wages alone, they appear to operate very differently across individuals,
states, and industries.

Before we can make any clear policy prescriptions about what

governments should do to, or for, unions we need to know more about the nature of this
heterogeneity to establish under what conditions employers and unions can increase the size of
the pie.
And then finally we asked Richard Freeman whether he was surprised by any of these
findings. He kindly read the paper and told us,
32

1) he was most surprised by the fact that the public sector wage effects are so large and so
similar to those in the private sector,
2) that we know little about the social costs of unions in the twenty first century. Consequently
he was unsure about the magnitude of the social costs, but would like to see empirical work on
the issue although he said would be ‘stunned’ if there were large effects, but as any good
empiricist he would let the data speak,
3) he was not surprised by any of our other findings.
So there you have it!

Notes: 1996-2001 data files exclude individuals with imputed hourly earnings. Controls for 1996-2001 are 50 state
dummies, 46 industry dummies, gender, 15 highest qualification dummies, private non-profit dummy, age, age
squared, log of weekly hours, 4 race dummies, 4 marital status, year dummies + union membership dummy
(n=546,823). Estimates for 1974-1979 are adjusted upwards by the average bias found during 1979-81 of .033.
Controls for 1974-1979 are 9 census division dummies, 46 industry dummies, years of education, age, age squared,
log of weekly hours, 4 race dummies, 4 marital status dummies, 5 year dummies + union membership dummy
(n=183,881). Tenure estimates for 1974-1979 obtained from the May 1979 CPS and for 1996-2002 files and
February 1996 and 1998 Displaced Worker and Employee Tenure Supplements and January 2002 and February
2000: Displaced Workers, Employee Tenure, and Occupational Mobility Supplements. Freeman/Medoff’s sample
consists of non-agricultural private sector blue-collar workers aged 20-65 (n=64,034 for 1974-1979 and 142,024 for
1996-2001).

Notes: Wage gap estimates calculated taking anti-logs and deducting 1. Columns 1 and 2 are taken from Table 3 of
Blanchflower and Bryson (2003). Column 3 is taken from column 5 of Table 4 of Hirsch and Schumacher (2002).
Data for 1973-81 are from the May CPS Earnings Supplements. a) 1973-1981 May CPS, n=38,000 for all sectors,
and n=31,000 for the private sector. Controls comprise age, age2, male, union, years of education, 2 race dummies,
28 state dummies, usual hours, private sector and 50 industry dummies. For 1980 and 1981 sample sizes fall to
approx. 16,000 because from 1980 only respondents in months 4 and 8 in the outgoing rotation groups report a
wage. Since the May CPS sample files available to us do not include allocated earnings in 1979-81, the series in
columns 2 and 4 are adjusted upward by the average bias of 0.033 found by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) using
these May CPS data for 1979-81. The data for 1973-1978 do not include individuals with allocated earnings and
hence no adjustment is made in those years. b) Data for 1983-2002 are taken from the MORG files of the CPS.
Controls comprise usual hours, age, age2, four race dummies, 15 highest qualifications dummies, male, union, 46
industry dummies, four organizational status dummies, and 50 state dummies. Sample is employed private sector
nonagricultural wage and salary workers aged 16 years and above with positive weekly earnings and non-missing

38

data for control variables (few observations are lost). All allocated earners were identified and excluded for the years
1983-88 and 1996-2001 from the MORG files. For 1989-95, allocation flags are either unreliable (in 1989-93) or not
available (1994 through August 1995). For 1989-93, the gaps are adjusted upward by the average imputation bias
during 1983-88. For 1994-95, the gap is adjusted upward by the bias during 1996-98. In each year there are
approximately 160,000 observations for the US economy and 130,000 for the private sector in the MORG; in the
May files, sample sizes are approximately 38,000 and 31,000 respectively until 1980 and 1981 when sample sizes
fall to approximately 16,000 and 13,000, respectively, as from that date on only respondents in months four and
eight in the outgoing rotation groups report a wage.
The Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) wage gap reported in column 3 is the coefficient on a dummy variable for union
membership in a regression where the log of hourly earnings is the dependent variable. The control variables
included are years of schooling, experience and its square (allowed to vary by gender), and dummy variables for
gender, race and ethnicity (3), marital status (2), part-time status, region (8), large metropolitan area, industry (8),
and occupation (12).

It has been cited an astonishing 1024 times over its near twenty year life (is it really that long?). In 2002 alone it
had 34 cites. It is clear that the book continues to be relevant.
3

Richard Freeman has devoted a lot of his subsequent writings to an examination of unionism in the public sector
including Freeman (1986, 1988), four chapters written with co-authors in Freeman and Ichniowski (1988), and a coauthored paper on union wage gaps for police (Freeman, Ichniowski and Lauer, 1989). Freeman’s other post-FM
work on union wage effects includes an international comparative paper with one of the authors (Blanchflower and
Freeman, 1992), and the impact of union decline on rising wage inequality in the United States – see for example
Freeman, (1993, 1995, 1999); Freeman and Katz (1995); Freeman and Needels (1993) and Freeman and Revenga
(1998). For a discussion of the issues involved see Blanchflower (2000a).
4

For further discussions on these issues see Lewis (1986), Freeman (1984) and Blanchflower and Bryson (2003).

5

In contrast Lewis (1986), who did not restrict his analysis to non-agricultural private sector blue-collar workers
aged 20-65 as FM did, found no differences by either gender or color although he confirmed FM’s other
disaggregated results. Lewis reported a number of additional disaggregated results that were not examined by FM.
Lewis found the wage gap was greater for married workers; U-shaped in age/experience; U-shaped in
tenure/seniority minimizing at 22-24 years of seniority; was higher the higher is the unemployment rate. He found
mixed results regarding any relationship with the industry concentration ratio.
6

Sample sizes in many cases were likely very small as is made clear from their footnote 11 which says that they
limited their sample of industries to ones containing at least five union and non-union members. The rule resulted in
only four industries being dropped.

7

FM use 1977 union density rates in table 2.1.

8

These estimates are obtained from the ORG files. Although numbers for the public and private sectors as a whole
are available since 1973, the breakdown by federal, state and local employee only begins in 1983.
9

We do not deal here with a further problem identified by Card (1996) of misclassification of self-reported union
status in the CPS, first identified by Mellow and Sider (1983). Card concludes that about 2.7% are false positives
and 2.7% are false negatives. Given that there are more non-union workers than union workers, this means the
union density rate is biased upwards. See Farber (2001) for a discussion and a procedure to adjust the union density
rate for error. In 1998, the observed private sector rate of 9.7% translates to an adjusted rate of 7.4% (the figures for
1973 were 25.9% and 24.5% respectively).
10

The number of wage observations followed by the percentage imputed in parentheses (hourly + non-hourly paid)
in the NBER MORG are given below. Note in 1995 allocation information is only available on one-third of the
wage observations, hence the small sample.

11

A revised version of their paper, due for publication in the Journal of Labor Economics in 2004, exploits the
unedited earnings data for those years.

12

Although there are some differences in the levels of the wage differences reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 3
the majority of these results are consistent with the findings reported by FM in their Figure 3.1. Major exceptions
are FM’s finding that wage gaps were higher for men than women and for non-whites compared with whites. We
suspect such differences arise because of the small sample size in the May 1979 CPS of 6,018 used by FM.

13

Nearly all federal workers have wages set by civil service pay schedules, but these are not set by collective
bargaining in any meaningful sense. Even with workers in the exact same federal job, one will say she is a unin
member and the other will say she is not. Thus the low union premium for federal workers may not be very
meaningful. For state and local workers (and some groups of federal workers like postal workers) the union status
variable provides meaningful information. We thank Barry Hirsch for this point.

14
15

Tables for the analyses presented in this section are available from the authors.
We have added data for 2002 as the 2002 ORG has recently become available.

16

The May extracts of the CPS extracts in Stata format from 1969-1987 are available from the NBER at
http://www.nber.org/data/cps_may.html.

17

Hirsch, Macpherson, and Schumacher (2002) have compared union wage gap estimates obtained from the BLS
quarterly Employment Cost Index (ECI) constructed from establishment surveys and from the annual Employer
Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) with those obtained using the CPS. They find that union/non-union
wage trends in the three series ‘are consistent neither with each other nor with the CPS’, and ultimately conclude
that ‘we find ourselves relying most heavily on results drawn from the CPS’ (Hirsch, Macpherson, and Schumacher,
2002, p.23).

18

There was no CPS survey with wages and union status in 1982.

19

Following Mincer, it is more usual to include a term in potential experience rather than a direct measure of age.
We use education, however, for reasons of comparability as the CPS Outgoing Rotation Group files from 1993
report qualifications rather than years of schooling.

20

Similarly in the 2003 edition of Hirsch and Macpherson’s Union Membership and Earnings Data Book, recently
received.

21

There is a dissonance between the estimates Lewis offers by way of summary in his introductory chapter and
those given in his Table 9.7 which are produced here (Lewis, 1986, p. 9).

22

Lewis (1986) had 35 studies using the CPS, 1970-1979; 16 studies using the 1967 Survey of Economic
Opportunity; 25 studies using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1967-78; 15 studies using Michigan Survey
Research Center survey data other than the PSID, including the 1972-73 Quality of Employment Survey; 22 studies
using the National Longitudinal Surveys of 1969-72; and 8 studies exploiting other sources.

23

FM’s smaller sample sizes by industry could account for some of the greater variation in their estimates.

24

Bratsberg and Ragan (2002) also use CPS data. But their analysis differs in several ways. First, they assess
trends over the period 1971-1999 whereas we present trends over the period 1983-2001. Second, we adjust for wage
imputation as recommended by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) whereas Bratsberg and Ragan do not. Third,

55

specifications producing the regression-adjusted estimates differ somewhat. Fourth, the samples differ. In
particular, Bratsberg and Ragan exclude government workers and they present results for some different industries.
Fifth, their wage premium relates to weekly wages whereas all of our estimates are derived from (log) hourly wages.
25

The import penetration variables are calculated as the ratio of imports to industry shipments. Bratsberg and
Ragan (2002) in their footnote 19 report that they tabulated shipments through 1994 from Feenstra (1996) and
thereafter from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, U.S. Merchandise Trade, series FT900 (December) and
Manufactures’ Shipments, Inventories and Orders (http://www.census.gov)

26

When the equations are run on the two machines using OLS they are identical. The problem appears to arise from
the different tolerances used across computers and not from differences in the STATA programs.

27

According to the 2002 Human Development Report Table 5 (http://hdr.undp.org/) the population of the US in
2000 was 283.2 million compared with 60.6 million in the UK and 7.2 million in Switzerland.
28

He finds wages of highly unionized occupations in Las Vegas’s hotel and gaming industry are significantly higher
than wages of identical occupations in less unionized Reno.

29

The source of the data is the Union Membership and Coverage Database which is an Internet data resource
providing private and public sector union membership, coverage, and density estimates compiled from the Current
Population Survey (CPS) using BLS methods. Economy-wide estimates are provided beginning in 1973; estimates
by state, detailed industry, and detailed occupation begin in 1983; and estimates by metropolitan area begin in 1986.
The Database, constructed by Barry Hirsch (Trinity University) and David Macpherson (Florida State University),
is updated annually. The Database can be accessed at http://www.unionstats.com.
30

The main exceptions are Maine, Hawaii and Vermont which are small and which had increases in the wage gap.
Florida is the fourth largest state after California, Texas and New York but its differential declined by 10 percentage
points.

31

32

Source: http://data.bls.gov/labjava/outside.jsp?survey=la
We experimented with both the level of the unemployment rate and the log and the latter always worked best.

33

According to Peter Hart Associates, the percentage of non-members saying they would vote to form a union hit
50% in 2002, the highest percentage since their figures began in 1984 (when the figure was only 30%). See
http://www.aflcio.org/mediacenter/resources/upload/LaborDay2002Poll.ppt.
