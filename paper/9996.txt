The Effects of Offering Health Plan Choice within Employment-Based Purchasing Groups

NBER Working Paper No. 9996

JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
Over the last two decades, employers have increasingly offered workers a choice of health plans.
The availability of choice has the potentially beneficial effects of lowering the cost and increasing
the quality of health care through greater competition among health plans for enrollees as well as
allowing consumers to enroll in the type of coverage that most closely matches their preferences.
On the other hand, concerns about the potential for adverse selection within employment-based
purchasing in response to the availability of choice exist. In this paper, I examine the effects of
offering choice in employment-based purchasing groups on access to and the cost of employersponsored coverage. I find that greater availability of choice was associated with a reduction in the
premium of employer-sponsored coverage and an increase in the proportion of workers covered by
the plans offered by employers. However, most of the premium reductions were due to a shift from
family to single coverage within employment-based purchasing groups and a reduction in the
generosity of the plans in which employees were enrolled. The results are not consistent with the
availability of choice leading to lower premiums through greater competition among plans for
workers.

I. Introduction
Over the last two decades, employers have increasingly offered workers a choice of
health plans. From 1977 and 1998, the percent of employees offered more than one plan by their
employer grew from 18% to 66% (Gabel 1999). Two explanations for the decision of employers
to offer a choice among plans have been advanced in the literature. Employers offering a choice
of plans may be implementing a managed competition approach to benefit design. Under
managed competition, employers offer multiple plans with standardized benefits and require
workers to pay the incremental premium for more expensive plans out-of-pocket. The objective
is to create incentives for workers to make cost-effective enrollment decisions, which, in turn,
encourages plans through greater competition for enrollees within a firm to increase the quality
and lower the cost of the health care they provide (Enthoven and Kronick 1989).
The prevalence of health plan choice within employment-based purchasing groups,
however, is not consistent with the widespread adoption of a managed competition approach to
benefit design by employers. Long and Marquis (1998) examine the extent to which employers
offer a choice of plans, require employees to pay the incremental premium associated with more
expensive coverage, and provide quality information to employees and find that, in 1997,
relatively few employers had adopted the managed competition model. Approximately 28% of
employees offered a choice among plans faced an equal dollar employer contribution and only
one-quarter of the largest employers offering a choice of plans provided employees with quality
information. (Levy 1997) finds that only one-sixth of employee contributions to health plan
premiums can be explained by the adoption of managed competition using employer survey data
from 1993.

An alternative explanation for the decision of employers to offer a choice among plans is
that they are responding to heterogeneity among individuals within the firm in their preferences
for health insurance (Goldstein and Pauly 1976). The hypothesis underlying this work is that
employers minimize compensation costs by offering workers their optimal combination of cash
wages and fringe benefits (Summers 1989). For employers hiring workers with varying
preferences for health insurance, this implies that optimal compensation for the workforce
requires offering multiple health plans, with each being the preferred choice of a subgroup of
employees. Theoretical studies examining employer health benefit choices when employees
vary in their preferences for coverage have demonstrated the tradeoffs employers may make
between the costs of greater customization and their incentives to offer employees plans that
more closely match individual preferences (Goldstein and Pauly 1976; Danzon 1989; Bundorf
2000). In these types of models, the existence of plan choice in employment-based purchasing
groups is driven by heterogeneity in employee preferences for health insurance rather than a
strategy to foster competition among plans.
Recent studies have provided some empirical evidence supporting the role of employee
preferences in influencing employer health benefit choices. Variation in worker demographic
characteristics is positively associated with the decision of employers to offer a choice of plans
to workers and the extent of variation in the plans offered (Moran, Chernew et al. 2001; Bundorf
2002). Using tax prices as a measure of worker preferences, Gruber and Lettau (2000) find that
both the median and the dispersion of tax prices within the firm explain the decision to offer
coverage and the dollar value of coverage offered. Studies by Levy (1997) and Dranove, Spier et
al. (2000) suggest that the use of employee premium contributions is driven by within-firm
variation in health insurance preferences. While these studies suggest that workforce

2

composition is a determinant of employer choices, they also do not explain a large proportion of
employer purchasing behavior.
Relatively few studies have examined the implications of offering a choice of plans
within employment-based purchasing groups, and those that do generally examine the managed
competition approach to benefit design. In particular, Vistnes, Cooper et al. (2001) examine the
assumption that competition among plans for enrollees within an employment-based purchasing
group is necessary to generate gains from competition. In their theoretical work, they propose
that competition among plans to be offered by an employer is equally or may be even more
effective in lowering premiums. In their empirical work, however, they find support for
managed competition in the sense that that premiums decline when employers offer additional
plans and make a fixed dollar contribution to the plan premium.
Cutler and Reber (1998), however, provide evidence that requiring workers within a
group to pay the full marginal cost of more expensive plans may lead to adverse selection within
employment-based groups. They examine the effects of the switch to a managed competition
style fixed premium contribution within a single employment-based purchasing group and find
that gains from competition in the form of reduced premiums were offset by losses due to
adverse selection. In the group they studied, the more generous PPO plan was eliminated by an
adverse selection “death spiral” within 3 years of the introduction of the policy. The results
suggest that offering plans that are differentially attractive to different risk types, in combination
with a fixed employer premium contribution, will likely trigger significant adverse selection in
insurance coverage 1.

1

A “pure” managed competition approach would require standardized benefits to reduce incentives for selection
based on risk type.

3

Taken together, these studies suggest that, while shifting the cost of more expensive plans
to employees in the form of higher employer premium contributions may generate competitive
pressures resulting in lower premiums, moving too aggressively in that direction may induce
significant adverse selection within a group. Although it does not explicitly examine the effects
of offering a choice of plans, one study questions even the competitive benefits of offering health
plan choice (Feldman, Dowd et al. 1993). These authors find that offering an HMO raises the
average premium per covered worker for both single and family coverage relative to offering
only a fee-for-service plan. Not only were HMOs more costly than FFS plans, offering an HMO
with a FFS plan increased the premium of the FFS plan, resulting in overall increases in the cost
of employer-sponsored coverage. The study, however, was based on data from 239 Minnesota
firms in 1986, suggesting that results are unlikely to be generalizable either to the nation as a
whole or the current managed care environment. In addition, it is unlikely that the authors were
able to adequately control for endogeneity in the decision to offer an HMO, potentially biasing
the results.
While these studies provide important insight into the potential challenges facing
employers in offering choice among plans, their results are somewhat at odds with overall trends
in the market. While traditional FFS plans have been nearly eliminated from the market, PPOs,
another less restrictive type of coverage, have co-existed and even thrived along with HMOs.
Theoretical work suggests that multiple-choice arrangements with an employment-based group
will not necessarily be plagued by adverse selection. Chernew and Frick (1999) demonstrate that
the potential effects on equilibria of introducing a managed care type of product in the market are
ambiguous. They model managed care as adding a third dimension, “managedness”, to the
premium and cost sharing product space and find that, in cases where an equilibrium existed in

4

the two-dimension product space, the introduction of managed care may result in no equilibrium.
On the other hand, managed care may generate an equilibrium in cases in which one did not exist
in the two-dimensional analysis by allowing low-risk consumers an additional mechanism to
distinguish themselves from high-risk consumers. In addition, employers may adopt premium
contribution policies that support the stability of multiple-choice arrangement. Rather than
adopting a fixed employer contribution, employers may set differential contributions across plans
in order to maintain the stability of multiple choice arrangements in the face of risk variation
among workers (Cutler and Reber 1998; Pauly and Herring 2000).
While numerous studies have demonstrated that existence of biased selection based
health risk among different types of plans, with HMOs and managed care plans generally
experience favorable selection (Hellinger 1995), this type of risk segmentation does not
necessarily signal the existence of adverse selection (Pauly 1984). Preferences for health plans
may be correlated with health risk, resulting in risk segmentation even in the absence of
imperfect information. Based on this observation, Feldman and Dowd (2000) propose that
managed care may be an efficient mechanism to segment risks, allowing low risk consumers to
purchase full coverage at a price closer to the actuarially fair premium, although others have
argued that the actions taken by plans to attract low risk consumers are inefficient (Newhouse
1996). Arguably, enrollment in HMOs in a firm offering a choice of plans may signal the
existence of adverse selection if the workers enrolled in these types of plans would have
preferred a more generous plans at the actuarially fair premium. However, studies examining
enrollee satisfaction have found higher satisfaction among HMO enrollees with a choice among
plans than those without a choice at the time of enrollment (Ullman, Hill et al. 1997; Gawande,

5

Blendon et al. 1998). This is more consistent with efficient risk segmentation than the existence
of widespread adverse selection.
In summary, relatively little is known about the effects on consumers of the trend toward
greater prevalence of choice among health plans. The availability of choice has the potentially
beneficial effects of lowering the cost and increasing the quality of health care through greater
competition as well as allowing consumers to enroll in the type of coverage that most closely
matches their preferences. On the other hand, concerns about the potential for adverse selection
within employment-based purchasing in response to the availability of choice exist. In this
paper, I examine the effects of offering choice in employment-based purchasing groups on
access to and the cost of employer-sponsored coverage. I hypothesize that the introduction of
managed care, HMOs specifically, facilitated the offering of choice within employment-based
purchasing groups. I then use geographic variation in the availability of HMOs in the 1990s as
an instrument for offering health plan choice. I find that greater availability of choice was
associated with reductions in the premiums of employer-sponsored coverage and increases in the
proportion of workers covered by the plans offered by employers. However, most of the
premium reductions were due to a shift from family to single coverage within employment-based
purchasing groups and a reduction in the generosity of the plans in which employees were
enrolled. The results are not consistent with the availability of choice leading to lower premiums
through greater competition among plans for workers.

II.

Theoretical Framework

A. The Employer’s Decision to Offer a Choice of Plans

6

The analysis is based on a model of an employer choosing a set of health benefits with
the objective of minimizing total compensation costs when workers in a firm have heterogeneous
preferences for health insurance. The model is based on two important assumptions. First,
employees bear the full incidence of health insurance premiums in the form of lower cash wages.
This is supported by empirical evidence of wage offsets based on average, but not individual,
characteristics (Gruber 1994; Pauly and Herring 1999; Sheiner 1999). Second, variation exists
among workers in their preferences for health insurance and imperfect sorting of workers among
firms based on these preferences exist. This is also likely to be true. Individuals vary in income,
risk aversion, and preferences for a style of care, all of which may affect their preferences for
health insurance coverage. In addition, the matching of workers to jobs is likely to be influenced
by factors other than health insurance preferences resulting in within firm variation in demand
for health insurance.
In order to motivate the analysis of the effects of health plan choice, I present a simple
theoretical model of the decision of an employer to offer a choice of plans. Assume a worker of
type i maximizes utility, which is function of money (m) and health insurance (k), by allocating
his or her total compensation between taxable cash wages (w) and health insurance. Let
 *i *i 
 w , k  be





the allocation between cash wages and health insurance that satisfies this condition for

a worker of type i. In this analysis, this quantity is defined as the employee’s benchmark
quantity – the quantity the employee would have chosen in the absence of the employer as the
purchaser.2

2

It is worthwhile to note that the employee’s benchmark quantity is not the optimal quantity. By reducing the price
of health insurance relative to cash wages, the tax treatment of health benefits creates incentives for workers to
purchase greater amounts of health insurance than they would have otherwise. Thus, the tax treatment of employersponsored coverage creates welfare loss through the distortion of the quantity of coverage purchased by the

7

For an individual employee, the employer’s cost minimizing allocation of compensation
between cash wages and health insurance is the employees’ optimal allocation (Summers 1989).
Thus, in a firm comprised of workers with homogeneous preferences for health insurance, an
employer minimizing total compensation costs will offer a single plan, the most preferred plan of
workers in the firm. More likely than the case of perfect sorting, however, is the existence of
within firm heterogeneity in preferences for coverage. Goldstein and Pauly (1976) consider the
case of a cost-minimizing firm choosing a single level of coverage to offer two types of workers.
They assume the firm must hire a fixed quantity of workers of two different skill types due to
production requirements and that preferences for health insurance are perfectly correlated within,
but differ between, worker skill types.
The employer’s problem is as follows:
Min C = LA ( w A + πk ) + LB ( w B + πk )

w A , w B ,k

such that

worker of type i is based on the assumption that the worker is able to obtain his or her
benchmark wage and health insurance compensation package from an alternative employer.
Solving the employer’s problem produces the following condition defining the single level of
coverage chosen by the firm.

employee. In addition, this excessive amount of coverage has second order effects on the quantity of health services
consumed by employees due to the existence of moral hazard in health insurance (Pauly 1986).

In equation (2), the firm equates the cost of deviations from the optimal level of health insurance
for each type of worker. The cost to the firm of increasing a unit of coverage is the per unit
premium less the corresponding wage differential for each type of worker which is necessary to
maintain the worker’s reservation utility level. Assuming type A workers have stronger
preferences for health insurance than type B workers, the single level of coverage chosen by the
firm will be less than the benchmark level for these workers. Because the marginal utility of
health insurance relative to wages for type A workers is greater than the marginal cost of health
insurance, an increase in the level of coverage would result in a decrease in cash wages
necessary to retain workers of type A that is greater than the price of the incremental unit of
health insurance. For the type B workers, the firm offers a quantity of health insurance that is
greater than the worker’s benchmark quantity, and the value workers place on the incremental
units is less than their marginal cost. Thus, increasing the amount of health insurance provided is
costly to the firm in the sense that it would be less costly to compensate these workers in the
form of additional cash wages.
Danzon (1989) quantifies the cost to the employer of heterogeneity in worker preferences
when the firm offers only one plan:

where k is the solution to the firm’s one plan cost minimization problem, ti is the marginal tax
rate for a worker of type i, and F1 is the fixed cost of offering a single plan. The employer could

9

reduce heterogeneity costs by offering workers of each type their benchmark wage and health
insurance compensation package. However, offering multiple plans is also costly for the firm.
These costs are in the form of increased loading resulting from fewer workers enrolled in each
plan and the fixed costs of administering multiple plans. In deciding between offering one or
two plans to a workforce made up of two types of workers, the firm’s decision rule can be
expressed as follows:
The firm offers two plans if:

where F2 is the fixed cost of offering multiple plans.
Thus, the firm compares the cost, in the form of incremental wages, of not providing each
type of worker with his or her benchmark level of coverage to the incremental cost of offering
two plans. The decision to offer a choice of plans is a function of worker preferences for
coverage, the number of workers overall and the number of workers of each type, the per unit
price of health insurance.
In this model of employer behavior, employee premium contributions are necessary to
induce workers to self-select into particular types of plans. The favorable tax treatment of
employer-sponsored coverage is contingent upon satisfying certain non-discrimination
requirements which are intended to prevent discrimination in the provision of fringe benefits in
favor of highly compensated employees. While the specifics of the non-discrimination
requirements vary by the funding and structure of the employer’s health benefit plan, in general,
they require that all plans offered by an employer are offered to all workers in the firm with some

10

exceptions.3 based on age, full-time status, tenure with the firm, union status, and residency
status. Thus, in a multiple-choice setting, employers may adopt employee contributions to create
incentives for workers to enroll in less expensive plans. However, in many cases, employee
premium contributions are not considered tax-exempt compensation. As a result, employers
have incentives to minimize the size of these contributions. Bundorf (2000) finds that the
differential tax treatment of employee and employer premium contributions, combined with the
non-discrimination rule, creates incentives for employers to reduce the extent of differentiation
between plans offered and reduces the extent to which offering multiple plans reduces total
compensation costs when workers have heterogeneous preferences for coverage.
B. The Effects of Offering a Choice of Plans
In this model, employers make health benefit choices with the objective of minimizing
total compensation costs for a given set of workers where total compensation costs are the sum
of cash wages and health insurance premiums:

Ti = ∑ wl + Lc * K

(6)

L

where L represents the number of employees in the firm, Lc is the number of workers
covered by health insurance, wl is the cash wage received by employee l when the employer
offers health insurance, and K is the average premium paid by the employer for health insurance.
The employer offers a choice of plans if T n >1 < T n =1 where n is the number of plans offered, and
the primary empirical prediction is that offering a choice of plans will reduce total compensation
costs.

3

Exceptions include employees under the age of 25, part-time and seasonal workers, workers with less than 3 years
of service, workers covered by a collective bargaining plan, and non-resident aliens.

11

The effects on the components of total compensation, however, may vary. On net, the
reduction in total compensation could be due to either a reduction in total cash wages, a
reduction in total health insurance premiums, or a reduction in both. However, either component
of compensation could increase if the corresponding reduction in the other were larger. For
example, the average premium may increase for an employer offering a choice of plans rather
than a single plan due to an increase in the generosity of coverage on average, if a more and less
generous plan are offered, but a greater proportion of employees enroll in the more generous
coverage. In addition, higher loading of premiums resulting from smaller numbers of workers
enrolled in each plan could increase average premiums. Holding all else constant, however,
differential selection of employees among plans should have no effect on average premiums. In
the case that average premiums rise, the value that employees place on the new coverage must
exceed the cost of providing it and employers must be able to make the corresponding wage
adjustment. If premiums decrease on average, through a shift in enrollment to a lower cost plan,
for example, in equilibrium, cash wages are likely to increase. However, the increase in cash
wages would have to be less than the decrease in premiums to create incentives for employers to
offer the new benefit. In either situation, the proportion of workers covered by the employer
should be non-decreasing.
C. The effect of managed care on the decision to offer a choice among plans
Although the term “managed care” encompasses a wide range of health insurance
products, in general, it refers to arrangements under which health insurers structure contracts
with providers to influence the types of care plan enrollees receive (Glied 2000). In this analysis,
the introduction and growth of managed care, and HMOs specifically, is considered an increase
in the extent of product differentiation in the market. Consumers are likely to have differing

12

preferences on the extent to which they value health insurance benefits in this managed form,
and employers will offer a managed care plan if the product is more desirable for at least a subset
of consumers within the firm or if it allows them to efficiently segment risks. Whether the
availability of a new product increases the likelihood of an employer offering a choice of plans,
however, depends on the extent to which consumers vary in the value they place on HMOs or
managed care. If workers within a firm similarly place high value on the managed care plans,
employers are likely to replace their existing coverage with the new product, rather than offering
a choice of plans, and correspondingly, if workers within a firm similarly prefer non-managed
care plans, the employer is unlikely to switch. However, if variation exists among workers
within the firm in the value they place on this coverage or the employer is using the plan for
efficient risk segmentation, the employer is likely to offer a choice of plans.
III.

Empirical Methods

A. Empirical Model
Estimation is based on the following empirical model:

T i = α + β 1C i + β 2 X i + ε i

(7)

where T i represents total compensation per worker in firm i, assuming the number of workers in
the firm is fixed, Ci is an indicator of whether the employer offers workers a choice of plans
(n>1) and Xi is a vector of variables which are controls for other exogenous determinants of firm
level average workers compensation. This empirical framework can also be used to examine the
individual components of total compensation:

W i = α + β 1C i + β 2 X i + ε i
K i = α + β 1C i + β 2 X i + ε i

Pi = α + β 1C i + β 2 X i + ε i
13

where W i is average cash wage, K i is the average premium, and Pi = Lc / L is the proportion of

workers covered by the employer . Because the effects of choice on cash wages and average
premiums cannot be signed a priori based on the theoretical model, the effect of choice on these
variables is an empirical question. However, the theoretical framework does predict that firms
offering a choice of plans cover a greater or equal proportion of workers than if they offered a
single plan.
A concern in estimating this model is that unobservable characteristics of firms may
affect both the generosity of health insurance overall and the decision to offer a choice of plans.
In addition, the decision to offer a choice of plans may be endogenous with respect to the
dependent variables measuring total compensation. For example, firms with high average
premiums under a traditional plan may be more likely to adopt a choice of plans than those with
low average premiums. For these reasons, I use an instrument, an indicator of the availability of
an HMO in the employer’s county, to generate exogenous variation in the propensity of
employers to offer a choice of plans to workers. The instrument is discussed in greater detail in
section B.
A. Data
The primary data source is the 1993 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)
Employer Health Insurance Survey (Long and Marquis 1997). The survey includes
establishment level data for 22,890 public and private employers in ten states in 1993. The
primary advantages of the survey for this analysis are that it was conducted at the establishment
rather than the firm level, reducing the measurement error associated with a geographically based
instrument, and during a time of rapid managed care penetration, which affects the validity of the
instrument. Survey respondents provided information about the establishment and its workers

14

and relatively detailed information about the health insurance plans offered. Cantor, Long et al.
(1995) provide descriptive statistics and information on sampling methods and survey design.
I exclude 1,516 public establishments and those reporting health insurance is negotiated
by union contract because these types of establishments may follow an alternative model of
decision-making. The study sample is also restricted establishments with greater than 25
employees and those that offer health insurance to workers. Establishment size is strongly
correlated with both the probability of offering health insurance and the probability of offering a
choice among plans (Figure 1). These differences suggest that the effect of the availability of
HMOs on the decision to offer a choice of plans may differ based on establishment size.
Preliminary testing using multivariate linear probability models revealed that the availability of
an HMO in the county of the employer did not have a statistically significant effect on the
probability of offering a choice of plans, conditional on offering health insurance, for
establishments with 25 or fewer workers. However, the availability of HMOs did have a positive
effect on the probability of offering health insurance for these smaller employers, particularly for
those with 10 or less employees. These results suggest that the decision to offer a choice of
plans, and particularly the role of HMO availability in facilitating choice, is most relevant for
employers with greater than 25 workers. I eliminate 7,118 establishments not offering health
insurance and 9,589 establishments with 25 or less employees. Of the remaining 4,667
establishments I exclude 118 for missing or invalid data for key study variables, primarily
industry and state identifiers. 4,549 observations remain in the study sample.
Dependent Variables
The focus of the empirical work is the health benefits offered by employers, including
health insurance premiums and coverage rates. Although cash wage compensation is an

15

important component of the theoretical analysis, the establishment level survey does provide
adequate and reliable data to test hypotheses regarding cash wage compensation4. As a result,
measures of total and cash wage compensation are not analyzed in this paper. Each dependent
variable is described below.
Three dependent variables measure premium per covered worker in the establishment and
the allocation of average spending between employer and employee premium contributions:
1.

Average premium: the average premium for plans provided by the employer, weighted
by the proportion of workers enrolled in each plan and the distribution of enrolled
workers between single and family coverage.

2.

Average employer contribution: the average employer contribution to the premium for
plans provided by the employer, weighted by the proportion of workers enrolled in each
plan and the distribution of enrolled workers between single and family coverage.

3.

Average employee contribution: the average employee contribution to the premium for
plans provided by the employer, weighted by the proportion of workers enrolled in each
plan and the distribution of enrolled workers between single and family coverage.
The variables above include information on both the generosity of the plans offered by

the employer based on plan characteristics as well as employee coverage decisions regarding
dependents. In order to isolate plan from coverage generosity, I estimate models using two
measures of plan generosity. The first measures employer spending on premiums independent of
employee coverage decisions. The second controls for potential differences across plans in

4

The survey does provide information on the distribution of worker wages based on four broad categories.
However, in establishments offering health insurance, over 40% of workers fall into the highest wage category,
making it unlikely that this variable will allow me to capture small effects on the wage distribution. Another
candidate variable is total annual payroll combined with total annual labor hours. However, the median value of
payroll per hour for establishments in the sample is over $200, raising questions regarding the validity of the
reported values.

16

characteristics that affect the generosity of coverage. The objective of this variable is to isolate
competitive effects on premiums from potential changes in plan generosity related to offering a
choice of plans.
4.

Average single premium: the average premium for plans provided by the employer
assuming all workers are enrolled in single coverage of each plan, weighted by the
proportion of workers enrolled in each plan.

5.

Average standardized premium: the average of the premium for single coverage, holding
plan generosity constant, weighted by the proportion of workers enrolled in each plan.
Premiums are standardized using a regression model of the relationship between plan
characteristics and employer characteristics and plan premiums for single coverage. The
model is estimated on plan level data including 19,031 plans offered by employers
included in the RWJF survey using ordinary least squares. A standardized premium was
calculated for each plan by predicting the premium holding the plan characteristics
constant at the mean in the sample. The average standardized premium is the average of
these predicted values for each employer. Appendix Tables 1 and 2 present descriptive
statistics and the results of the estimation.
A key hypothesis from the theoretical model is that offering a choice of plans increases

the proportion of workers in a firm covered by the health insurance offered by the employer.
The following dependent variables test this and also directly examine shifts between single and
family coverage:
6.

Proportion covered: the proportion of employees covered by the plans offered by the
employer.

17

7.

Proportion family coverage: the proportion of covered employees enrolled in family
coverage.
Finally, I examine variables describing employer contribution policies to identify a

mechanism for observed coverage changes:
8.

Full contribution –single coverage: Indicator of whether the employer contributes the full
premium for single coverage for at least one plan.

9.

Full contribution-family coverage: Indicator of whether the employer contributes the full
premium for family coverage for at least one plan.
Summary statistics for dependent variables are presented in table 1.

The study variable of primary interest is the indicator of whether the establishment offers
a choice among health plans. The models also include a set of exogenous firm and market
characteristics to control for other factors that contribute to differences across establishments in
employee compensation. Establishment controls include establishment size (categorical
indicators 1-10, 11-25, 26-50, 51-100, 101-250, and >250 employees), whether the establishment
is part of a larger nationwide organization (to control for economies of scale in the purchase of
health insurance and employee compensation), for-profit status, and the distribution of the
workforce by age and sex. The survey collects information on the proportion of workers falling
into three age categories: <25 years, 25-54 years, and 55 and older by sex. Using these
variables, I also construct a measure of heterogeneity in preferences for coverage among workers
in the firm based on their predicted health expenditures, an estimate of the coefficient of
variation of predicted health expenditures (Bundorf 2000). In some models, I include the wage
distribution of workers in the firm to control for differences in demand for coverage across

18

establishments. Because these variables are likely to be endogenous, however, I exclude them
from most specifications. Market controls include the county population, the county per capita
income, the HCFA wage index and characteristics of the medical market including percent of
county discharges that were financed by Medicaid and the number of inpatient-hospitals in the
county offering residency programs. All models also include state (10) and industry (9) fixed
effects. Descriptive Statistics are presented in Table 2.
Instrumental Variables
As discussed earlier, the effect of choice in the empirical model is likely to be biased by
differences in unobserved characteristics between establishments offering and those not offering
a choice of plans as well as the endogeneity of choice with respect to premiums. I address these
issues by instrumenting for the propensity of employers to offer a choice of plans with an
indicator of whether an HMO is available in the county of the establishment. I hypothesize that
the availability of an HMO creates an alternative coverage choice, which allows employers to
more effectively segment workers based on preferences for health care and health insurance than
variations in cost sharing in a traditional indemnity plan. The identifying assumptions are that the
availability of managed care lowers the cost to the employer of offering a choice among plans
and that the entry of managed care organizations into a market is independent of the
characteristics of the employers in that market. One potential weakness of this strategy is that
demand for HMOs differs across counties and the availability of managed care plans represents
differences in the average demand across firms in the county rather than random variation in
HMO location choices. The year of the data used in the analysis addresses this issue somewhat.
Managed care penetration was increasing rapidly during this period. In 1991, 60% of countries
had at least one HMO serving the country (Table 3). By 1996, this had grown to 93%. I propose

19

that the rapid entry during these years was conducted independent of employee demand for
health insurance within individual firms. Managed care organizations were not able to
accurately assess systematic differences across markets in employee preferences for coverage
and instead made decisions based on factors such as market size and the existing organization of
providers. In line with this hypothesis, I estimate an additional set of models restricting my
analysis to markets in which an HMO had entered by 1996, suggesting that the market was
ultimately attractive to HMOs.
C. Model estimation
All models are estimated using either ordinary least squares or two stage least squares.
The first stage models are linear probability models, which will produce consistent estimates
using two stage least squares (Heckman 1978). Heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors are
calculated for all models presented (White 1980).

IV.

Results
Thirty-seven percent of establishments in the study sample offered a choice of plans

(Table 1). Average health insurance premiums were higher in firms offering a choice of plans
($257) than those offering a single plan ($244). Employers offering a choice of plans, however,
also made larger contributions to the plan premium ($177) than those offering a single plan
($163), with the result that average employee contributions were similar between the two types
of firms. The average monthly premium assuming all employees were enrolled in single
coverage of their chosen plan was also similar between the two types of firms ($143). Holding
plan generosity constant, however, plan premiums were higher for firms offering a choice of
plans were higher in establishments offering plan choice ($143) than those offering a single plan

20

($140). This is consistent with the proposition that firms choosing to offer a choice of plans
were those facing higher average premiums due to factors such as the composition of the
workforce or local health care costs. Both the proportion of employees covered (0.71 vs 0.60)
and the proportion of enrollees with family coverage (0.47 vs 0.45) were higher in
establishments offering a choice of plans. Establishments offering a choice of plans were also
more likely to fully contribute to at least one plan in the case of both single and family coverage.
These results are consistent with employers offering a choice of plans offering more
generous benefits in general. Employers offering a choice of plans cover a higher proportion of
employees and provide family coverage to a greater proportion of covered workers. In addition,
they are more likely to offer a plan requiring no employee contribution to the plan premium.
Although average premiums for single coverage are similar between employers offering a choice
of plans and those offering a single plan, adjusting for plan generosity indicates that underlying
premiums are actually higher for employers offering a choice. This indicates that the plans in
which workers enroll in these establishments are actually less generous based on their observable
plan characteristics.
In the first stage regression, the indicator of whether an HMO is available in the
establishment’s county has a large, positive and statistically significant effect on the probability
of offering a choice among plans (Table 4). The availability of an HMO in the country of the
establishment increases the likelihood that the employer offers a choice of plans by 14
percentage points in the full sample (Table 4-Models 1 and 2) and 15 percentage points in the
subsample based on the future availability of an HMO in the establishment’s county (Table 4Models 3 and 4). Including the wage distribution of workers in the firm as controls for variation
across establishments in demand for health insurance has virtually no effect on the magnitude or

21

statistical significance of the effect of HMO availability, reducing concerns of omitted variables
measuring worker demand for coverage. As anticipated, establishment size is highly correlated
with the probability of offering a choice of plans. Establishments with more employees and
establishments that are part of a larger firm are more likely to offer a choice among plans.
Variation in workers preferences for coverage as proxied by variation in expected health
expenditures is also positively correlated with the decision to offer a choice of plans as expected.
The results of the models for average premium indicate that offering a choice of plans
reduced the average premium paid by employers for workers and that the primary mechanism for
the reduction was an associated shift from family to single coverage. The point estimates of the
effect of offering a choice of plans using OLS are small and not statistically significant (Table 5,
Models 1-3). The effect of choice on average premium in the instrumented model, however, is
large, negative and statistically significant (Table 5, Models 4 and 6). In these models, offering a
choice of plans reduces the average premium for employer-sponsored coverage by $85 to $100.
Although this seems implausibly large at first glance, the results from Models 5 and 6 suggest
that most of the effect was driven by a shift from family to single coverage. Controlling for the
proportion of employees enrolled in family coverage, the magnitude of the effect of choice
declines substantially and becomes statistically insignificant at conventional levels. In Models 5
and 6, the proportion of workers enrolled in an HMO does not have a statistically significant
effect on the average premium within an employer-sponsored group.
Tables 6 and 7 examine the allocation of these premium reductions between employee
and employer premium contributions. OLS results reveal a small, statistically insignificant
positive effect of choice on both employee and employer premium contributions. IV estimates,
in contrast, reveal larger negative effects on both employer and employee contributions.

22

However, the negative effect is only statistically significant in the model of the employer
contribution using the full sample (Table 6 – Model 4). In the instrumented models, controlling
for the proportion enrolled in family coverage generally reduces the magnitude of the point
estimate of the effect of choice on both employee and employer premium contributions, although
the effect is larger for employer contributions (Tables 6 and 7 – Models 5 and 6). Comparing the
magnitude of the decline in contributions in the employee and employer premium contribution
models with those of the average premium model, I find that between 65 and 75% of the decline
in premiums was in the form of declining employer contributions. The remainder was passed on
to employees directly in the form of lower premium contributions. Offering a choice of plans
does not have a statistically significant effect on the average employer share of the premium for
covered workers (Table 8). In the instrumented models, the point estimates are positive (Table 8
– Models 4 and 6), indicating that employers contributed a higher proportion of the plan
premium in firms offering a choice of plans, although once again, these effects are not
statistically significant.
I control for the effects of changes in premiums driven by changes in coverage by
calculating average premiums assuming single coverage for all employees enrolled in a plan.
Using OLS, I find the offering a choice of plans was associated with a small reduction in average
premiums, about $5 (Table 8 – Models 1 and 2). Much of the reduction can be explained by a
shift to HMO enrollment (Model 3). The magnitude of the negative effect is larger, however,
using instrumental variables. In the full sample, offering choice reduces the average premium
for single coverage by $41, and controlling for the proportion enrolled in an HMO has little
effect on the estimate. Although these seems implausibly large given the average in the data for
the average premium assuming single coverage is $143, it is important to consider that these

23

estimates do not control for differences in the generosity of the plans offered. For example,
employers adding an HMO to a more traditional FFS plan may increase the cost sharing of the
FFS plan to induce employees to enroll in the HMO. These types of changes would presumably
be reflected as changes in the premium for the affected plan.
The results in Table 10 suggest that these types of changes in the generosity of plans may
take place when firms offer a choice of plans to workers. The dependent variable in these
models is the average premium, holding plan generosity constant, for covered employees
assuming all employees are enrolled in single coverage of a particular plan. In this case, I find
that offering a choice of plans has virtually no effect on average standardized premiums. The
point estimates are small relative to the mean of the dependent variable ($141) and generally
statistically insignificant. These results suggest that the negative effects of average premiums for
single coverage were largely driven by corresponding changes in plan generosity. Similarly,
they provide no evidence that offering a choice of plans drives reductions in plan premiums
through competitive effects.
The results suggest that offering a choice of plans increases the proportion of workers in
a firm covered by health insurance (Table 11). Using OLS, offering a choice of plans is
associated with an increase of 5 percentage points in the proportion of workers in the
establishment covered by health insurance (Table 11 – Models 1 and 2). This is true even after
controlling for the wage distribution of workers. Using IV, the estimates are of similar
magnitude and direction, unlike the results for the other dimensions of employer health benefit
offerings. However, the estimates are less precisely estimated and are not statistically significant
(Table 11 – Models 3 and 4).

24

Although offering choice is associated with an increase in the proportion of employees
within an establishment covered by health insurance, IV estimates suggest that it is also
associated with a significant shift from single to family coverage among covered workers (Table
12). Using OLS, offering a choice is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the
proportion of covered workers enrolled in family coverage (Table 12 – Models 1 and 2).
However, IV estimates suggest significant, approximately 20 percentage point, declines in the
proportion of workers enrolled in family coverage. The results in Table 13 indicate a possible
mechanism for the dramatic declines. The dependent variables in this analysis are whether the
employer contributes fully to at least one single coverage plan and at least one family coverage
plan. Using OLS, employers offering a choice of plans were 8 percentage points more likely to
fully contribute to at least one single coverage plan (Table 13- Model 1) and 4 percentage points
more likely to fully contribute to a family coverage plan (Table 13- Model 4). However, using
instrumental variables, the magnitude of the effect of choice on the probability of offering the
full contribution single plan was much higher – over 20 percentage points, while the effect of
offering a choice of plans on the probability of fully contributing to a plan providing family
coverage was negative – between 2 and 6 percentage points. The IV estimates, however, are
imprecisely estimated and thus can only be considered suggestive.

V. Conclusions
The prevalence of health plan choice within employment-based purchasing groups has
increased over the last two decades. This results of this analysis of the effects of offering a
choice among plans within employment-based purchasing groups are more consistent with a
model of employers choosing to offer a choice of plans in response to heterogeneity among

25

workers in their preferences for health insurance than with the objective of generating
competition to reduce the premiums and increase the quality of the health plans they provide. I
find that the availability of health plan choice was associated with an increase in the proportion
of workers in a firm covered by the health insurance offered by the employer and reduction in
average premiums for employer-sponsored coverage. Premium reductions, however, took place
primarily through reductions in the generosity of coverage received by employees, both in the
form of less generous plans and fewer workers within a firm enrolling in family coverage. I find
no evidence that the availability of choice among plans generated premium reductions through
greater competition among health plans for enrollees within the firm.
The analysis also indicates the importance of generating exogenous variation in
determinants of employer choices, in this case the decision to offer a multiple plans, to examine
the effects of these choices on workers. In this analysis, I use the availability of an HMO in the
county of the employer as an instrument for offering a choice of plans. While the results for the
effects of choice on the proportion of workers covered by the employer were consistent between
the OLS and IV models, many of the other results were not. In particular, the findings regarding
reductions in both plan and coverage generosity associated with health plan choice were specific
to the IV estimation. The opposite conclusions would have been drawn using OLS. This could
potentially be driven by both unobserved characteristics of workers or firms positively affecting
both the generosity of the benefits offered by the employer and compensation more generally and
the decision of the employer to offer choice or the endogeneity of the decision to offer a choice
of plans with respect to employer spending on health insurance. Employers characterized by
higher average premiums for reasons independent of the generosity of the plans they offered may

26

have been more likely to offer a choice of plans in response. Either case would result in a
positive relationship between choice and premiums using OLS.
Overall, the findings indicate that gains in employee coverage were offset by both
declines in the generosity of plans offered by employers and losses in dependent coverage. The
implications for the welfare of consumers are dependent upon the extent to which consumers
valued the lost benefits as well as the extent to which they were compensated for their loss. For
example, reductions in plan generosity, such as the switch from a FFS plan to an HMO or an
increase in cost sharing, may represent either a reduction in highly valued benefits or a
movement away from inefficiently high levels of coverage. Workers gaining coverage are likely
to be better off, particularly if they were previously uninsured. In the case of declines in
dependent coverage, the welfare implications depend on the extent to which dependents had
access to coverage from alternative sources. If these declines primarily targeted dual-working
families who were enrolled in potentially duplicative plans, this may have had positive welfare
implications. If those who lost dependent coverage were able to find it from an alternative
employer or public source, the changes represent a transfer rather than an inefficiency.
However, for those who lost coverage and went uninsured, the change was ultimately welfare
reducing.
For reductions in both plan and coverage generosity, the net effect for individual workers
also depends upon whether they coincided for corresponding increases in cash wages or other
fringe benefits. While one mechanism for transferring compensation to workers is by reducing
employee premium contributions, the results do not indicate that employers passed the bulk of
the premium on to employees in the form of higher employer contributions to plan premiums.

27

However, we were unable to directly examine the effects of changes in benefits on cash wages,
either at the level of the establishment or the level of the individual.
In addition, it is important to note that the changes observed in the instrumented models,
particularly in the case of the declines in family coverage, may not have been a direct result of
offering health plan choice, but rather driven by underlying changes in the health care market
that coincided with or even drove the diffusion of managed care. For example, rising health care
costs may have created pressure for employers to reduce health benefit costs. This may have
been accomplished by two strategies, a shift to managed care and a reduction in contributions to
dependents.
The findings of this study make three important contributions to the literature on health
plan choice. First, they provide greater support for the decision of employers to offer a choice of
health plans as a response to heterogeneity among employees in their preferences for health
insurance than an explicit strategy to foster within-firm competition among plans for enrollees.
Similarly, the results are not consistent with widespread adverse selection in response to
employers offering workers a choice among plans. The availability of choice was associated
with an increase, rather than a decline, in the proportion of workers in an establishment covered
by the health insurance offered by the employer. Although the availability of choice appears not
to be driving declines in within firm coverage rates due to adverse selection, it is possible that
choice is welfare reducing for some workers if, for example, they are enrolled in a managed care
plan when they would prefer an alternative type of plan. This, however, is not consistent with
literature indicating that those enrolled in HMOs who faced a choice of plans are more satisfied
with their coverage than those not facing a choice. Finally, the results highlight the importance
of considering household decision making when evaluating the effects of employer decisions.

28

Our results indicate that many employees responded to the availability of choice from an
employer by dropping coverage for dependents. Yet, evaluating the implications of this requires
more information on the coverage alternatives available to dependents and their ultimate choices.
